            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nSet near the Suiattle River and surrounded by mountain peaks and old-growth forest, the Suiattle Guard Station (pronounced \"Sue-attle\") is a historic log cabin that was constructed in 1913 by \nTommy Thompson, Assistant Ranger of the Suiattle-Finney District, to house a forest guard.<br/><br/>\n \nBecause of budget limitations at that time, the Forest Service often relied upon rangers to construct their own stations. It is a testament to Ranger Thompson`s skill \nthat the cabin survives to this day as one of the oldest administrative buildings in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The Suiattle Guard Station was placed \non the National Register of Historic Places in 1990.<br/><br/>\n\nThe cabin is accessible by car. Many creature comforts are provided, but guests will need to bring a few of their own amenities to ensure a comfortable and enjoyable\nstay. <h2>Recreation</h2>\nSeveral hiking and equestrian trails crisscross the area, which are accessible from Suiattle River Road (Forest Service Road 26). Anglers can also find fishing spots nearby.<br/><br/>\n\nFederally protected under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, the Suiattle River is popular among whitewater enthusiasts. River runners paddle Class 2 and 3 rapids through lush forested scenery, with views of nearby snow-capped peaks. Since the headwaters of the river originate at a glacier, the water has a milky appearance. July and August are the best times for rafting.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe cabin can accommodate four people with one full size bed with mattress and one futon. Other amenities include a table, two benches, two chairs, a propane \nrefrigerator, stove, lantern, cookware, dishes, utensils, water heater and a wood stove. A bathroom with a shower and flush toilet is located at the back of the guard station, and a primitive vault toilet is located \n20 feet from the building. Firewood is available outside the cabin.<br/><br/> \n\nThere is room on-site for up to four tents and two RVs. No electrical hook-ups are available. The water source to the building consists of a spring that is run \ninto a small collection box on the hillside behind the cabin and piped into the building. This water is not drinkable and is to be used only for the toilet.<br/><br/>  \n\nDrinking water is not available. Guests must bring enough water for drinking, cooking, and washing.<br/><br/>\n\nPropane canisters are not provided for the lantern, so guests must bring their own propane canisters. Other items to bring include food, a backup light source, \nsleeping bags, towels, dish soap, matches, a first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. All trash and food must be packed out, and guests are expected to clean the\ncabin before leaving.\n \n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nHemmed in by several designated wilderness areas, the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest showcases rugged peaks, sparkling alpine lakes and old-growth forests. The charming log cabin sits on a gently sloping lawn at the edge of the forest.<br/><br/>\n\nNearby Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area, dominates the landscape on a clear day.

On a clear day, visitors are treated to spectacular views of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness from the top of the 41-foot tower.<br/><br/>\nThe tower was completed in 1963 and served as one of the last lookouts built by the southwestern Oregon Forest Service until the mid 1990's, when it was converted for recreational purposes.\n<br/><br/>\nToday campers can enjoy a unique lodging experience in the historic structure, which offers basic amenities and spectacular views of the surrounding area. Although the facility provides basic amenities, guests must bring a few of their own supplies to ensure a safe and comfortable stay.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe nearby Upper Chetco Trail is the main east/west route through the Kalmiopsis Wilderness. It offers access to the Chetco River and two main tributaries. Heavy vegetation provides shade but eliminates most views, and at least three significant long and steep sections provide a challenging backpacking experience.\n<br/><br/> \nAnglers will enjoy the remote location and scenic backdrop of the nearby Chetco River, providing angling opportunities for trout, steelhead, and salmon in season. The Chetco starts in steep, deeply dissected, sparsely vegetated, mountainous terrain within the Kalmiopsis Wilderness.\n<br/><br/> \nAt night the lookout is an ideal setting for stargazing, as constellations and planets put on a dazzling display.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe one-room lookout rests on the top of a 41-foot timber tower, surrounded by a catwalk. It is furnished with a single bed, a table and two chairs, a stool, broom and fire extinguisher. It also features a wood stove, a propane stove for cooking and a propane refrigerator. A vault toilet is located near the tower.\n<br/><br/> \nThere is no water or electricity available at the site. Guests must bring water for drinking, cooking and washing. In addition, visitors will need to supply a light source, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, cooking gear, towels, dish soap, matches, a first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. Firewood is provided.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe lookout affords panoramic views of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness and the Chetco River drainage. The Kalmiopsis Wilderness is an area of great geological and botanical interest. Many of the rocks were formerly parts of the oceanic crust, while diverse plant life provides evidence of adaptation to the area's harsh soils.\n<br/><br/>\nThe Kalmiopsis leachian, a shrub discovered in the Gold Basin area in 1930, is a relic of the pre-ice age. The Kalmiopsis Wilderness is named after this unique endemic plant.\n<br/><br/> \nDiverse landscapes provide habitat for a wide-range of wildlife, from spotted owls and black-tail deer to salamanders and salmon. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed wetlands, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.",
            "FacilityDirections": "From Brookings and U.S. Highway 101, drive east on North Bank Chetco River Road (County Road 784). This becomes Forest Service Road 1376 in approximately 8 miles. Turn left after crossing the South Fork Bridge (16 miles from Brookings). Turn right on Forest Service Road 1917, approximately 1 mile after the bridge. Follow Quail Prairie signs staying on Forest Service Road 1917. The lookout is 3 miles beyond Packer's Cabin. The total distance is 26 miles.<br/><br/>  \nThe roads are generally one-lane and gravel, with pullouts. Many people use these roads, including logging trucks, forestry workers, and recreational vehicles. Drive slowly, stay to the right side of the road at all times, and use pullouts.",

It extends from the Chelan Mountains in the northeast to the Entiat Mountains in the west.  The Entiat River Valley splits the Entiat Mountains from the Chelan Mountains, with the Columbia River flowing to the south and the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area standing majestically to the north. The landscape is dominated by wildfire ecology. Many areas of the Entiat Ranger District are excellent to observe examples of forest restoration, after large wildfires have occurred. Elevations range between 800 to more than 9,000 feet. The total acreage is 272,101 acres, which includes the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area at 25,557 acres.</p><p>High-quality recreation of all types exists in the Entiat Ranger District. The broad range of campgrounds and hiking trails provide access into relatively undeveloped zones of the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest that are excellent for hiking and fishing in solitude. Deep in the Glacier Peak Wilderness Area, at the end of the Entiat River Trail you can observe the last remaining remnants of the once massive Entiat Glacier. The glacier still clings to the impressive Entiat headwall, home to three 9,000’ peaks: Mt. Maude, Seven Finger Jack and Mt. Fernow. The Entiat Ranger District is also home to one of the nation’s most extensive multiple-use trail systems. This beloved trail system parallels lush alpine meadows, passes with pristine mountain lakes and climbs to lofty summits with breathtaking views of the wild North Cascade Range. Much of this trail system can be traveled by off-road motorcycles, mountain bikes, horses or hiking. </p><p>The Entiat Ranger District is also part of a larger success story occurring on the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest. Proper land management practices have made the ranger district an amazing place for viewing a wide variety of wildlife. This includes elusive species like wolverine, moose, deer, bear, eagles, salmon and steelhead that frequent the Entiat Ranger District.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/fseprd549747.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>Entiat River Road Mileage chart</strong></a> -- shows distance to campgrounds and road junctions from Highway 97A.</p>",

The lookout was built in 1948 and has served as a fire detection site for the surrounding area. \n<br/><br/>\nHistorically, Forest Service personnel lived long seasons in the cabin, scanning the region for lightning, flames, curls of smoke or any other indicator of possible forest fires. At one time, hundreds of these types of lookouts were in service throughout the Pacific Northwest. Today the lookout provides a unique lodging experience for guests seeking recreation and relaxation in the Fremont-Winema National Forest.<br/><br/>\n\nAlthough the lookout offers some basic amenities, for guests to enjoy their experience completely, they must bring several of their own supplies.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nHiking, stargazing and wildlife viewing are popular activities. The Drake-McDowell area provides solitude for backpackers and horseback riders with spectacular views of the Warner Mountains, Hart Mountain, Warner Valley and Abert Rim. A  hike to the summit of Drake Peak is a popular excursion from the lookout. \n<br/><br/>\n\nAt night the lookout is an ideal setting for stargazing, as constellations and planets put on a dazzling display.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe small, 14 x 14-foot lookout is designed to accommodate up to four people and is furnished with folding cots, a table and chairs, a wood stove for heat and limited counter space for food preparation. A picnic table is located outdoors, as is a vault toilet.   \n\nThere is no water on site, so guests must bring sufficient supplies for drinking, cooking and washing. Guests may fill water jugs at Mud Creek Campground approximately 6 miles away. Guests must also provide their own sleeping bags, sleeping pads, towels, dish soap, matches, cooking gear, first aid kit and firewood.  \n\nAlthough lighting is available, it is recommended that guests bring an additional light source in case of emergencies. The Forest Service does not provide firewood for this facility.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nDrake Peak Lookout sits beneath a vast sky, overlooking distant peaks, volcanic landscapes and wide-open sage basins. From its scenic perch, the lookout offers panoramic vistas and glimpses into wild places where visitors can still find solitude.<br/><br/>\n\nAlthough the lookout does not sit on Drake Peak, the nearby mountain is one of several high peaks in the immediate vicinity, including Twelvemile Peak, Light Peak and Crook Peak. Composed of uplifted and eroded basalt, and sparse vegetation, views from this mountain offer unobstructed views of unique geological landforms. \n<br/><br/>\nDiverse habitats support a variety of species. Deer, Rocky Mountain elk and pronghorn find homes in nearby forests, while several varieties of trout inhabit the lakes and streams. In the spring and fall, migrating geese, ducks and swans frame the Oregon sky. Black bears, mountain lions and bobcats, also find homes in the surrounding area.",

Located on the edge of a large meadow it provides campers with beautiful views of the nearby water and surrounding nature.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nNeighboring Driftwood Campground is at the head of the Tam McArthur Trail which is a short, reasonably easy hike that provides great views of the Sisters - Faith (North), Hope (Middle) and Charity (South). The Three Sisters are volcanic peaks and are the third-, fourth- and fifth-highest peaks in Oregon.<br/><br/> \n\nThree Creeks Lake is easy to fish from shore or by wading, but boat fishing is the most popular method. Only non-motorized boating is allowed.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThree Creeks Meadow Horse Camp can accommodate RV, trailer or tent-campers however water and electric hookups are not available. This is a no water facility so campers will need to bring their own supply however livestock water is available for horses. All sites have four corrals and are equipped with a picnic table and campfire ring with grill and the campground has vault toilets available.<br/><br/> \n\nThis campground shares the area with the <a href=\"https://www.recreation.gov/camping/three-creeks-meadow-campground/r/campgroundDetails.do?contractCode=NRSO&parkId=153803\" rel=\"nofollow\">Three Creeks Meadow Campground</a>. Sites 001 - 011 are for regular camping and the sites 012 - 020 are for horse camping only.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nNamed for the adjacent Three Creeks Lake, this campground is just a short drive from the water with wonderful views of lake and surrounding area. Located in a glacial cirque below Tam McArthur Rim, the lake is 28-acre alpine gem with an elevation of 6,550 ft. surrounded by old growth forest. The outlet stream from the lake flows northward and is joined by two other streams to form Three Creek. The shoreline of Three Creek Lake varies from gentle slope to rocky cliff. Maximum depth is 28 feet down the center and near the cliff on the south end of the lake.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe close proximity to the town of Sisters offers many additional amenities and attractions, as well as the nearby Tam McArthur Trail and Sisters Wilderness Trails.<br/><br/>\n\nVisitors can explore wilderness areas, rivers, lakes and reservoirs, and approximately 1,600 miles of trails that comprise nearly 2.5 million acres within the Deschutes National Forest and the adjacent Ochoco National Forest. Many enjoy traveling the Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway, known as Oregon's Highway in the Sky, which climbs into the clouds on a 66-mile drive through the Cascade Range, weaving past snow-capped peaks and alpine lakes.<br/><br/>\n\nTo the north the Camp Sherman Fish Viewing Platform allows visitors the chance to view a variety of types of fish while the Metolius Research Natural Area gives bird watchers ample opportunities. Visit the Metolius Fish Hatchery or Wizard Falls Fish Hatchery display ponds to observe and feed different types of salmon and other fish. The Metolius-Windigo Trail, open to hikers, bikers and horses, is more than 100 miles in length and begins near the Metolius River headwaters west of the town of Sisters, Oregon. The trail was created in the 1980s primarily to serve long-distance horse riders seeking an alternative to the Pacific Crest Trail.<br/><br/>\n\nLava Lands Visitor Center in nearby Bend, Oregon, and the unique geological landscape of Newberry National Volcanic Monument draw visitors to the region as well. It is a great starting point for visitors to learn about the diverse landscape and history of the area through interpretive programs and exhibits.  Visitors can also explore the Lava River Cave, located in the Newberry National Volcanic Monument. At 5,211 feet in length, the northwest section of the cave is the longest continuous lava tube in Oregon.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nThe Tilly Jane A-Frame is an ideal getaway for individuals, groups and families who enjoy the great outdoors in the beautiful Pacific Northwest.  The facility is one of the oldest structures on Mt. Hood and is a popular cabin used by winter recreationists. Peak season for use of the cabin is usually November through June.. It provides access to scenic terrain, specifically hiking, snowshoeing and backcountry skiing activities.\n<br/><br/>\nDuring the summer months (usually July-September) the A-Frame is easily accessed by taking a short quarter mile walk through the Tilly Jane Campground. During the winter months ( October-June), it serves as a winter retreat for persons hardy enough to make the effort to get to the cabin from the Tilly Jane Sno-Park. Winter conditions often exist for nine months of the year.  Visitors can ski to the cabin following a 9 mile gently sloping road or climb the historic Tilly Jane ski trail which is roughly 2.7 miles, with an elevation gain of 1,900 feet.  Skis or snowshoes are highly recommended!\n<br/><br/>\nGuests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety.  Backcountry travel experience is highly recommended.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nVisitors must hike, snowshoe or ski to the facility during the winter months.  During the summer season, it is possible to drive up and walk to the structure.  Multiple trails can be accessed from the A-Frame, some of which are well marked and others covered by snow for most of the year.\n  \nNearby trails offer a variety of day trips, including to the Cooper Spur Stone shelter which offers great views of the majestic Mt. Hood, St Helens, Mt. Adams and Mt. Rainer.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe 24-by-48, two story structure has a sleeping loft, accessed by a ladder that can accommodate up to 20 people.  More than one group may reserve the facility at the same time.  It is equipped with two picnic tables, benches, a few chairs and a wood stove for heating and boiling/melting snow.\n<br/><br/> \nIn warmer months, water can be found with a short walk to Tilly Creek.  We advise that all water be treated or boiled.  In winter, water can be obtained by digging an access hole to Tilly Creek or by melting snow using the pots provided at the cabin.  A primitive outhouse with a pit toilet is provided within the alcove of the structure.  You will need to bring your own toilet paper.\n<br/><br/>\nGuests will also need to provide sleeping bags and pads, warm clothing, headlamps, cooking pots/pans, stove and fuel, matches or a lighter.  It is best to treat your stay as a backpacking trip, bringing everything you'd need minus a tent.  Several lanterns and replacement mantels are available.  You will need to provide the one pound green propane canisters if you wish to use the lanterns.  Firewood and splitting tools are provided.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe A-Frame is located high on the north side of Mt. Hood at an elevation of 5,700 feet.  It is one of five structures within the Cloud Cap/Tilly Jane Historic District.  It was built in the late 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and was used extensively by the American Legion in its early days.  The facility is surrounded by old growth trees and is roughly 1,000 feet below tree line.  It is operated and maintained by the all-volunteer, Oregon Nordic Club, under permit from the Forest Service.  A cook shed is adjacent to the A-Frame, but has been condemned by the Forest Service.",

In summer months (usually between July-September), continue up the long winding Road #3512, veering left onto Road 630 near the top.

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nMusick Guard Station is located in a remote setting in southwestern Oregon, offering visitors a glimpse into a historic mining community in Umpqua National Forest. Situated atop a narrow forested ridge between Fairview Peak and Grouse Mountain, the guard station and outbuildings were constructed by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1934 to provide fire protection to the Bohemia Mining district.    \n\nListed on the National Register of Historic Places, Musick Guard Station became an important public contact point and administrative center for the Forest Service. Later it was used as summer barracks for trail crews and firefighting crews. The Guard Station was named after the nearby Musick Mine, a major gold producing mine in the late 1800s and early 1900s.  \n\nToday the guard station continues to offer visitors a unique lodging experience and plenty of opportunities for relaxation and recreation.  \n\nThis site is located in National Forest System lands. These sites are popular with the recreating public so you may find visitors interested in the area and the facilities. While you do not have to let them inside the facility they are allowed to be in the area.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nFor hiking and sightseeing, the nearby Bohemia Mountain Trail leads up a steep grade to the rocky summit of Bohemia Mountain, the highest point on the Cottage Grove Ranger District. Just east of the summit along a ridgeline hikers will be treated to dramatic views of the Cascade mountains and a wildflowers blooming along rocky outcrops and bluffs in late June through early August.  \n\n\nFor history buffs and fortune seekers, Musick Mine, one of the most productive gold mines in the district during the late 1800s and into the early 1900s, is a point of interest not to be overlooked. The area is named after James \"Bohemia\" Johnson, a mountaineer and prospector, who discovered gold-bearing quartz in 1863. The discovery created much short-lived excitement in the valley, but settlers soon realized the gold had to be extracted from the rock by machinery, not panned from the many streambeds, and by 1910 most of the ore had been removed. Some mining continues today.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe main floor of the two-story guard station features a central room with an adjoining kitchen and bedroom. The upstairs bunkroom provides additional sleeping quarters. It is furnished with two double wooden platform beds and four bunk beds without mattresses, a table with chairs, a wood stove for heat, and wood cook stove and oven. Outside, a picnic table, campfire ring, and vault toilet are provided. An area for pitching a tent is also on site.<br/><br/>\n\nThere is no refrigerator, water or electricity available at the site. Guests must bring water necessary for drinking, cooking and washing. Guests must also bring a lantern or other reliable light source, cooking utensils, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, towels, dish soap, matches, cooking gear, toilet paper, first aid kit and garbage bags. Firewood may be available, however the supply cannot be guaranteed, and guests are encouraged to bring their own.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nMusick Guard Station is surrounded by rugged summits up to 6,000 feet in elevation, and steep, heavily forested slopes of fir, spruce and hemlock.<br/><br/> \n\nNearby Fairview Peak, located in the heart of the Bohemia Mining District at an elevation of 5,933 feet, provides an excellent panoramic view of the surrounding area. On a clear day, the Cascade Range peaks can be viewed from Mt. Hood to the north and Mount McLoughlin to the south.<br/><br/>\n\nLarge mammals such as elk, deer, black bear, and cougar, as well as the smaller residents like squirrels, fox, raccoons and bats, are supported by the area's diverse forest habitats.<li>Learn more about <a href=\"http://www.centerforwildlifeinformation.org/BeBearAware/bebearaware.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">bear safety.</a>  \n<br/><br/>\n</li>\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nVisitors may want to take some time to visit nearby Crater Lake National Park for a glimpse into the area's fascinating geological and cultural history.

The original cabin was destroyed in the 2002 Biscuit Fire, a massive blaze that burned more than a half-million acres in Oregon and California, but was reconstructed just two years later.  \n  \nToday the lookout offers a unique lodging experience for guests seeking a bit of solitude and relaxation. Although the cabin offers some basic amenities, guests must bring a few of their own supplies to ensure an enjoyable stay.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nHiking, mountain biking, stargazing, and wildlife viewing are popular among guests to this lookout.<br/><br/>\n\nAn important component of the historic fabric of the watershed is the trail system. Hikers may want to wander trails that originally followed older aboriginal routes. \"Chief\" Elwin Frye, a packer for the Forest Service, identified a portion of the Snow Camp Trail as an Indian travel route. The trail is one of the oldest in the Forest, and provides access to Windy Valley, a pristine mountain meadow with a small crystal clear creek.<br/><br/> \n\nAt night the lookout is an ideal setting for stargazing, as constellations and planets put on a dazzling display.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe renovated fire lookout is a 15' x 15' structure, originally designed for one or two people. It is furnished with a double bed with a mattress, a table and chairs, cabinets and counter space for food preparation. It is also equipped with a wood-burning cook stove and a picnic table for outdoor dining. A pit toilet is located near the lookout.   \n\nThere is no water on site, so visitors must bring sufficient supplies for drinking, cooking and washing. Guests must also provide their own sleeping bags, sleeping pads, towels, dish soap, matches, cooking gear, toilet paper and garbage bags.   \n \nAlthough visitors can drive within sight of the lookout, the 200-yard hike to the summit can be strenuous when carrying gear. The final 200 yards to the lookout are open to administrative traffic only.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nOn a clear day, guests at Snow Camp Lookout will see ocean waves crashing along Kellogg Beach, Point St. George and Castle Rock near Crescent City, California.\n  \nEffects of the 2002 Biscuit Fire and the 2017 Chetco Bar Fire are obvious within the surroundings, though forested mountains and grassy hillsides dotted with pine trees extend from the lookout as well.",

The cabin can accommodate four guests, and a short walk through the trees awards a unique opportunity to view miles of the Umatilla National Forest from sunup to sundown. \n \nThe site was originally used as a fire detection lookout. The original structure was a platform built on a high tree in 1925. It was replaced with a 96-foot Aermotor tower in 1933, and a neighboring cabin was built to house Forest Service employees. A utility shed was also built. When the cabin burnt down in 1966, the shed was converted into housing. That same shed is where guests can stay today. The tower is also still standing, and when the tower is staffed, visitors are welcome to climb up and enjoy the view.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nOver 26 miles of trails throughout the Heppner Ranger District can be accessed from the cabin for hiking or horseback riding. Plentiful fishing opportunities abound in nearby streams and Bull Prairie Lake. Many roads are open to off-road vehicles, and 28 miles of designated trails are available. Other activities include hunting, wildlife viewing and bird watching. This site is not open in the winter. <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe cozy converted shed offers one room with amenities including propane lights, a heating stove and cook stove, cookware, silverware and dishes. Furnishings consist of two sets of twin bunkbeds, a cabinet for clothes, table with four chairs, and a rocking chair on the small front porch.  There is a picnic table and fire ring outside, though fire danger may restrict campfires, so check for conditions with the Ranger District prior to arrival. There is also a nearby outhouse.\n No water is onsite, so visitors must bring plenty for drinking, cooking and washing. There is no refrigerator either, so come prepared with a cooler and ice. Guests must bring food, water, ice chest with ice, bedding, toiletries, a first aid kit, flashlights, matches and all other basic camping gear.

It offers a uniquely peaceful setting on the water and along remote shorelines, surrounded by forests of Douglas fir and mountain hemlock. Recreation in the area is abundant with the lake an ideal location for water activities like sailing, canoeing and swimming.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nWaldo Lake is circled by the Jim Weaver Loop, 22 miles of trail for hiking and biking. Bikes are allowed on the trails, but not in the nearby Waldo Lake Wilderness. There is also easy access to the Pacific Crest Trail.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThis 55 site campground is located at the north end of Waldo Lake, just south of North Waldo Campground, 31 sites are reservable. Each site has a fire ring and picnic table.  There are three vault restrooms within the campground and another at the boat launch/day use area.   \n\nIslet offers wonderful sandy beaches. Western winds consistently blow each afternoon, offering respite from early season mosquitoes, which are typically intense from June to mid-August so come prepared.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nSituated high on the western slopes of the Oregon Cascades at 5,400 feet in elevation, Waldo Lake is one of the purest lakes in Oregon (9.8 square miles with a maximum depth of 427 feet). It has no permanent inlet to bring nutrients into the lake for plant growth. The lack of plant life contributes to its purity, allowing you to see to depths of 120 feet on a calm day.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe north end of Waldo Lake is a popular starting point for many wilderness trails and lakes, most notably the Rigdon, Wahanna and Torrey Lakes. The 1-mile Shoreline Trail between Islet and North Waldo campgrounds provides a short and pleasant hike along the lakeshore.",

Its main purpose at that time was as a firefighter guard station. \n<br/><br/>\nIn 1990, the cabin was converted to a horse camp and was recently restored by local volunteers and employees of the Butte Falls Ranger District. Today it is available for rent by groups with or without horses.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe cabin is adjacent to the Willow Prairie Campground , and is surrounded by 19 plus miles of horse trails. In addition to horseback riding, enjoy camping, hunting and winter sports, such as cross country skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling.<br/><br/>\nThe wetlands adjacent to the cabin provide an excellent area for birding enthusiasts to watch for sandhill cranes, great blue herons, Canada geese, ducks and red-tailed hawks.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe one-room cabin can accommodate up to four people, however it is furnished with only two sleeping cots. It has two shutter-style windows without glass, a wood stove for heat, and rustic furnishings, including a table and chairs. There is counter space for meal preparation and places to hang lanterns.

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nAmerican River Guard Station is located about 40 miles west of Naches, Washington on the banks of the American River in the eastern Cascade Mountains.\n<br/><br/>\nThe rustic cabin and outhouse were built by the men of the 932nd Camp Naches Civilian Conservation Corps crew in 1941 as a summer residence and work site for fire patrol and recreation management personnel.\n<br/><br/>\nIn the 1970s, volunteers and permit holders sporadically used the cabin, until it was found eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999.\n<br/><br/>  \nToday, the cabin, which is located in the heart of the central Cascades recreation area in eastern Washington off the scenic Mather Memorial Parkway, offers visitors a wonderful setting for year-round recreation and relaxation.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe cabin setting provides ready access to Bumping Lake, where boating and fishing are popular. Hiking and horseback riding trails extend into the William O. Douglas and Norse Peak Wilderness areas, and off-road vehicle and snowmobile access draws visitors to the Little Naches drainage. In winter, snow-shoeing and cross-country skiing are popular in the American River area.\n  \nThe cabin is also conveniently located 30 minutes below the summit of  Chinook Pass  and  Mt. Rainer National Park  . A trip along the scenic  Mather Parkway  is a fantastic outing.\n  \nThe American River, adjacent to the cabin, offers a scenic backdrop for anglers. Its cold, clear waters sustain populations of rainbow and brown trout.\n   \nWhitewater enthusiasts may enjoy a paddle on the American River or one of its tributaries. \n<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe Depression-era rustic cabin is one and a half stories tall, with a wood frame and shake roof. It has a small kitchen, a living/sleeping area, one bedroom and a full sized sleeping loft and storage room. \n  \nThere is a queen size sleeper sofa in the living room, a full size bed and mattress in the bedroom and four twin size beds with mattresses in the upstairs loft. Sleeping bags and sleeping pads are not provided.\n   \nThe cabin is furnished with a dining table and chairs for four people (with hidden leaf to expand for eight people), a small refrigerator and an electric range. There is a wood stove, electric light fixtures and a living room electric baseboard heater. Guests should be aware that open flame devises such as propane stoves, gas lanterns, and candles are prohibited indoors. \n  \nThe kitchen is equipped with a coffee maker, pots, dishes and glassware, but guests must bring several of their own supplies including food, cooking utensils, dish soap, towels, matches, garbage bags and a first aid kit.  \n  \nOutside, near the cabin, there is a picnic table and campfire ring. The original two-seater outhouse has been restored. Wood may be available, but the supply cannot be guaranteed.\n   \nThere is no water at the cabin, therefore visitors must bring plenty for drinking, cooking and washing. In the summer, drinking water can be obtained from the nearby Cedar Spring Campground.\n   \nThe cabin contains a variety of cleaning supplies. Visitors must remove all food and garbage, and clean the cabin prior to departure. In the summer, waste disposal is provide by a dumpster in the nearby American Forks Campground. When the campground is closed for the season, visitors must \"pack it in and pack it out.\"\n\n\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest is defined by its diverse landscapes, boasting high, glaciated alpine peaks, lush valleys of old growth forest, and rugged shrub-steppe country.\n    \nThe American River Guard Station is nestled in an old-growth forest of Douglas fir, western hemlock, and a cedar understory with grassy areas, ferns and mosses.\n    \nWith the William O. Douglas and Norse Peak Wilderness areas nearby, the location is home to abundant wildlife, including deer, porcupine, native fish, and migratory birds. Endangered and threatened species, including the Northern Spotted Owl, gray wolves and grizzly bears also find havens in local ecosystems. \n  \nSummer temperatures are generally sunny and warm with little precipitation, and winters boast mostly clear skies, but plenty of snow.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nHikers may want to traverse a portion of the spectacular  Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) , one of the world's premier National Scenic Trails. Enjoy some of North America's most fantastic scenery, as the trail winds from Mexico to Canada through Washington state. \n   \n Boulder Cave Trail  is one of the most popular places in the Naches District. Visitors can walk the accessible trail along the river or explore Boulder Cave. Interpretive signs along the trail explain the geology, plants, animals and history of the area. Other nearby activities include trails for horseback riding, biking, a lake with motorized and non-motorized access and a boat ramp, and winter opportunities for snowshoeing and xc skiing.",

This large lake is 3562 acres, 6 miles long and 1 1/2 miles wide, and reaches a depth of 282 ft. The average depth is 132 ft. which makes it ideal habitat for lake trout (Mackinaw) and bull trout. Rainbow trout, kokanee salmon and whitefish also naturally reproduce in this lake. Odell Lake is managed as a trophy lake trout fishery and has the distinction of the last two state record lake trout being caught here.

The wilderness has gentle, densely forested terrain with occasional steep areas. The name derives from the many small lakes, most of them clustered in several glacial basins near the crest of the Cascade Range. Several species of trees including Shasta red fir, western white pine, mountain hemlock, lodgepole pine, Engelmann spruce and whitebark pine are found throughout the area. The forest's understory is dominated by species of huckleberry, as well as manzanita, snowbrush, and heather.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nLake of the Woods is another nearby lake with USFS facilities and a full service family oriented resort just six miles down the road.  Travel along the Volcanic Scenic Byway as you explore the surrounding area.  Other stops of interest may include Kla-Mo-Ya Casino (57 miles), Fort Klamath Museum (35 miles), Collier Memorial State Logging Museum (60 miles), Pacific Crest Trail (within 2 miles) and Crater Lake (55 miles).",

In 1948 the tower was replaced with the current flat top structure.  \n\nThe tower is available for reservations October 15 through July 15 (lookout is utilized for fire season during the summer months). The roads to the lookout are not plowed, nor are they maintained for passenger cars. High clearance or four wheel drive vehicles are recommended for travel to this site, and guests must bring several of their own amenities. Please be aware that while very uncommon, during winter months guests may need to snowmobile, ski or snowshoe up to four miles to reach the lookout. <h2>Recreation</h2>\nHiking, birding and wildlife viewing are popular among guests. Seasonal changes envelope the area as snowmelt gives rise to spring flowers and vivid autumn colors welcome a landscape dusted with snow.  \n\nGuests may enjoy a day of scenic driving along a portion of the 172-miles Rogue-Umpqua National Scenic Byway. Mountain and river scenery unfold along the highway, showcasing everything from rolling oak-covered hills and towering coniferous forests to roaring white water rapids and incised inter-canyon lava flows.   \n\nSwimming at the Three C Rock Picnic Area, about 7 miles from the lookout, is also a refreshing way to spend a warm summer afternoon. \n\n\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe lookout cabin is a 12 x 12 room, set 40 feet above the ground. It is furnished with a single bed, and a small table and chair, and is equipped with a propane heater, lanterns, cooking stove with oven and a refrigerator (propane is provided). A vault toilet is located at the lookout site. There is a pulley system available to transport items from the ground to the lookout (use at your own risk). There is no water at the site, so visitors must bring plenty for drinking, cooking and washing. Potable water is available at a spigot in front of the Tiller Ranger Station office (20 minutes away via car).  \n\nGuests must bring several of their own supplies, including food, cooking utensils, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, towels, dish soap, matches, cooking gear, toilet paper and garbage bags.  \n\nThere is no trash service.  Pack out all food and garbage.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nIn 1898, homesteader William T. Pickett rode into this area on horseback and decided to stay and build a life and home. Perched atop the butte named after him, the Pickett Butte Lookout offers a view of the entire Jackson Creek Drainage and much of the lower elevation lands around the town of Tiller. The Rogue-Umpqua Divide, south and east of Pickett Butte, has scenic peak landmarks, which are capped with snow until early summer.<br/><br/> \n \nWater is abundant in streams and a handful of lakes in the area, and diverse plant communities provide habitat for abundant wildlife ranging from hummingbird to black bear. <br/><br/>\nLearn more about <a href=\"http://www.centerforwildlifeinformation.org/BeBearAware/bebearaware.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">bear safety.</a>  \n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nVisitors may want to take some time to visit nearby Crater Lake National Park for a glimpse into the area's fascinating geological and cultural history. \n",

Here beaver and otter make their homes. Visitors are sometimes treated to seeing and hearing the beaver's tail slaps.  Great blue heron and kingfishers are joined in fall and winter by ducks, geese, and bald eagles.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nMany people enjoy some of the state’s best German Brown trout fishing.   Due to ongoing dam repair Toketee Lake is 2-3 feet lower than the boat ramp, so small non-powered boats are best.  Toketee group site is located next to one of the trailheads for the famous North Umpqua Trail.  This trail is a favorite for hikers, bikers, and horseback riders.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nToketee group site offers a small pavilion with two tables and a large grill.  Next to the pavilion is a large, open grass area for tent camping.  Parking for the site doubles as the RV campsites.  This area’s surface is graveled and is big and fairly level.  With room for both tent campers and RV campers, this group site is able to accommodate most events.  Near the group site is Toketee Campground which has some sites available on a first-come, first served basis.  Should your group need more space, this campground may help with those needs.   There is no water available at the group site or the Toketee campground.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThis group site offers a picturesque spot for small groups to gather.  Lined with willow and mixed with maples and alders, this section of the river is very tranquil.  The nearby footbridge offers great views of the river and lake.  \n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThere are two spectacular waterfalls within a five-minute drive of the site.

The lookout offers visitors a unique lodging experience and panoramic views of the surrounding area.<br/><br/>\n\nOriginally developed in 1931 as a lookout site, Bald Knob served as an Aircraft Warning Service (AWS) observation station between 1942 and 1944. The Forest Service removed and replaced the original with the present flat top structure in 1963.<br/><br/> \n \nThe lookout tower is available for reservations from Memorial Day through October, and guests must bring several of their own amenities to ensure a safe and comfortable stay.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nHiking, birding, and wildlife viewing are popular among guests to this lookout. Seasonal changes envelope the area as snow melt gives rise to spring time flowers, and vivid autumn colors welcome a landscape blanketed with snow.  \nThe Panther Ridge Trail is accessible from the facility and follows an historic Native American travel corridor. Approximately 95% of this trail is within the Wild Rogue Wilderness, and is closed to any kind of motorized vehicles or equipment. The trail travels under magnificent stands of old-growth timber and through rhododendron and scrub oak undergrowth.  \n \nAnother notable trail is the nearby Coquille River Falls Trail. The hike switches back and forth through a virgin stand of undisturbed Douglas-fir, hemlock, and Port-Orford cedar trees, ending at the Coquille River Falls. Learn more about the  geology of waterfalls  along the Coquille River.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe 16 x 16 foot one-room flat top cabin is equipped with basic amenities, including a propane stove, heater, refrigerator and lights. Furnishings include a single bed and a small table and chairs.<br/><br/>\n\nOutside amenities include a picnic table and campfire ring. A primitive vault toilet is located approximately 100 feet from the tower. There is no water on site, so visitors must bring plenty of their own for drinking, cooking and washing.<br/><br/> \n\nGuests must also supply their own food, cooking utensils, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, towels, dish soap, matches, cooking gear, toilet paper and garbage bags. Although propane lighting is available, bringing an additional light source is recommended.<br/><br/>\nThe site has sufficient space for one small tent, but strong winds could blow a tent off the mountain unless adequately weighted down inside.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nVisitors to the Bald Knob Lookout will be treated to spectacular views overlooking Eden Valley to the north, the Rogue River to the south, and the forests beyond.<br/><br/> \n\n\nThe unique character of the landscapes comprising the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest has led to over 340,000 acres of the Forest to be preserved as a designated wilderness area, and over 200 miles of streams as National Wild and Scenic Rivers.<br/><br/>\n\n\nDiverse landscapes provide habitat for a wide range of wildlife, from spotted owls and bull elk to salamanders and sandhill cranes. These species, along with many others, depend on the undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed wetlands, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nVisit Crater Lake National Park and learn about its unique natural and cultural history.  Reaching depths of 1,943 feet,  Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the United States and one of the ten deepest lakes in the world.<br/><br/>\nExperience 172 miles of diverse river and mountain landscapes along the Rogue-Umpqua National Scenic Byway.

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nSituated in the vicinity of majestic Mount Rainier, Big Creek is a family campground nestled among Douglas firs, hemlock, alders and maples. The lush vegetation offers plenty of privacy between sites. <br/><br/>\n\nThe sites at Big Creek form a loop, with only a handful of sites sitting along the banks of Big Creek. Open from mid-May through late September, Big Creek provides an alternative to the campgrounds at Mount Rainier National Park, which can get very crowded during the summer. <h2>Recreation</h2>\nAnglers can try their luck at catching brook trout in Big Creek or for those looking to explore the area, the Osborne Mountain Trail starts at the campground. The route is steep, but the scenery is amazing, and the trail can be traversed by foot, horse, mountain bike or dirt bike. \n<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground requires vehicles to have a relatively tight turning radius. Big Creek can accommodate tents, trailers and RVs, with a maximum vehicle length of 22 feet. \n<br/><br/>\nSome parking spurs are paved; others are native moss and dirt. Some sites have rocks or heavy vegetation, which may make it difficult to pitch a tent. \n<br/><br/>\nDrinking water is available, but there are no hot showers available onsite. Vault toilets are provided as well as a pedestal grill, fire pit and picnic table at each site. \n<br/><br/>\nGray water disposal facilities are located throughout the campground.  \n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nLocated in southwest Washington State, the Gifford Pinchot National Forest encompasses over 1.3 million acres and includes the 110,000-acre Mount St. Helens National Volcanic Monument established by Congress in 1982. \n<br/><br/>\nBig Creek is located in the Cowlitz Valley Ranger District, the northernmost portion of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest. This Ranger District manages four Wilderness Areas including the Goat Rocks Wilderness, Glacier View Wilderness, Tatoosh Wilderness and William O' Douglass Wilderness. \n<br/><br/>\nThe Cowlitz Valley Ranger District is roughly located among three volcanic peaks: Mt. Rainier to the north, Mt. Adams to the east, and Mt. St. Helens to the west, providing visitors with a unique geological landscape. \n<h2>contact_info</h2>\nThis location has limited staffing. Please call (360) 686-3008 for general information.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nBig Creek is 6 miles from the Nisqually entrance of Mount Rainier National Park. The popular Henry M. Jackson Memorial Visitor Center at Paradise is 21 miles away, and the nearby town of Ashford offers restaurants, along with a few art galleries and shops. <h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Cancellations</p>\n<p>Individual Campsites: Cancellations up to 2 days before a reservation start date incur a $10.00 cancellation fee. </p>\n\n<p>A visitor who cancels a reservation the day before or on the day of arrival will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee including tax and applicable add-on for a campsite.</p>\n\n<p>Cancellations for a one-night reservation will forfeit the entire amount paid and will not be subject to an additional service fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date.

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nNestled in a grove of towering old-growth conifer trees, the Government Mineral Springs Guard Station is a delightful setting for guests seeking relaxation and recreation in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.<br/><br/>\n\nThe Government Mineral Springs area has been a draw to recreation enthusiasts since the early 1900's. In 1910, S.D. Fox and the Star Brewing Company of Portland began construction of a hotel near Trapper Creek, which eventually became known as Government Mineral Springs. The popular resort boasted bath houses, Iron Mike Bubbling Springs, a dance pavilion, store, ice cream parlor, goldfish ponds and flower gardens. Early advertisements for the resort claimed the mineral water spas were capable of curing physical ailments. In 1935, the hotel burned to the ground.<br/><br/>\n\nCamping remained popular at the site, and in 1937, the Civilian Conservation Corps significantly expanded and developed the public campground and built the guard station, which was used for Forest Service administration of the campground and other local recreational use. Today, the cabin provides a unique lodging opportunity.<br/><br/>\n\nGuests should be aware that during the winter season, the cabin is only accessible via a half-mile trek on skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles from the parking area. <br/><br/> \n\nThere is no motor vehicle access from the road that leads to the cabin when snow is present on the road. Parking at the snow park is required, and requires a snow park pass. This pass can be purchased at local vendors.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nMany recreational opportunities are within close proximity of the Guard Station, including fishing, hiking, biking, mushroom and huckleberry picking, hunting, skiing and snowshoeing.<br/><br/>\n\nNearby fishing opportunities include spring chinook fishing on the Wind River and lake fishing for brown and brook trout in Soda Peaks Lake, in Trapper Creek Wilderness.<br/><br/>\n\nA short drive from the cabin is the Falls Creek Falls Trail, a 3.5-mile round-trip hike for the whole family. Accessible year round, the trail follows a forested creek before crossing a suspension bridge, then traverses a side slope which offers views of the creek and interesting rock formations. At the end of the trail is lower Falls Creek Falls, a three-tiered waterfall which drops nearly 250 feet into a pool below the viewpoint. <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe two-story cabin can accommodate up to nine guests. The lower floor has a large kitchen with a propane stove, dining room and living room with a table and chairs, fireplace and two futon couches that fold out into double beds. Two upstairs bedrooms can accommodate five guests, with two single beds in one bedroom, and one bunk-bed that sleeps three in a second bedroom. Propane heat, lights and a cooking stove are provided along with wood for the fireplace. Pots, pans, dishes and cooking utensils are provided. A vault toilet is located on site.<br/><br/>\n\nThere is no potable water at the cabin, and guests are encouraged to bring plenty for drinking, cooking and washing. A stream within 300 feet of the guard station may be used as a water source; however, the water must be treated or boiled before drinking. Melted snow can be used for washing, but is not safe for drinking.<br/><br/>\n\n\nAlthough the cabin has several amenities, guests do need to provide their own sleeping bags, linens, towels, dish soap, matches, first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. Bringing an additional light source in case of emergencies is also advised. <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nTrapper Creek Wilderness is within walking distance of the guard station, boasting 6,050 acres of diverse habitat. Cascading streams and waterfalls are plentiful throughout the steep slopes at the lower elevations, while huckleberry fields occur higher near Observation Peak.<br/><br/>\n\nWildlife abounds in the area. Animals commonly seen include black tail deer, Roosevelt elk and black bear. The more elusive cougar, bobcat and pine marten are seen occasionally. Spotted owls, barred owls, pileated woodpeckers and goshawks inhabit the forest treetops. \n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe guard station is located between Mt. St Helens National Volcanic Monument and the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, convenient for day trips.",

Follow the Wind River Highway through Carson and northwest approximately 14 miles to the Carson National Fish Hatchery. Continue northwest for 1 mile on Forest Road 3065 to the entrance for Government Mineral Springs recreation site.  \n\nFrom approximately April 15 to November 1, the cabin is usually accessible by vehicle. During the winter season, the cabin is a half-mile trek by skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles from the parking area.   \n\nSno-Park permits are required from December 1 through April 1 for each vehicle. Washington Sno-Park passes are required for Washington State vehicles.",

The lookout can only be accessed by skis, snowmobiles or snowshoes, a distance of 2-10 miles. Conditions on the mountain change rapidly. You need to be evaluating conditions and weather throughout your stay. Sudden storms and high winds may make skiing and driving conditions difficult. Experience in cross-country skiing or snowshoe travel is highly recommended. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<br/><br/>\n\nThe reward is worth the effort of getting there. Guests will enjoy panoramic views of the pristine snow-covered landscape and starry skies on clear nights.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nWinter recreationists can enjoy cross-country skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling on the terrain in the nearby Middle Fork Willamette River - Moon Point Trail Area.<br/><br/>\nReaching the cabin on the 10-mile access road is part of the snow sport fun. Visitors might also catch a glimpse of any number of wildlife that lives in the area.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe 14x14-ft. cabin sits atop a 40-foot tower and is surrounded by a catwalk. The cabin accommodates 4 people and is furnished with one double bed that comfortably sleeps two, a table and chairs, propane stoves for heating and cooking, cookware, dishes, and a broom and dust pan. Propane is provided. Cell service may be available from the tower depending on your service provider.\n   \n\nThere is a vault toilet nearby. \n  \n\nNo water or electricity is provided.

A large pot is provided for this purpose. \n   \n\nItems such as bedding, extra mattresses, flashlights, matches, extra toilet paper, first aid supplies, trash bags, dish soap, and towels are not reliably available after mid-season. Guests are expected to pack out their trash and clean the cabin before leaving. \n  \n Absolutely no pets are allowed.  <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe lookout towers over forest cover of noble fir, mountain hemlock and silver fir at the crest of Warner Mountain. The lookout is close to Middle Fork Willamette River - Moon Point Trail Area, with a diverse habitat ranging from meadows to rocky cliffs and dotted with high-elevation conifers.  \n\nWillamette National Forest offers prime habitat for such species as Roosevelt elk, black bears, bald eagles, black tail deer and bobcats, among other wildlife.",

Dickerman Trail, located near the campground, switchbacks steeply for 3 miles through a dark forest to an alpine meadow, replanted in 1915 after a major forest fire. From this point, the trail rises above the timberline to an alpine meadow alive with wildflowers in July and August.<br/><br/>\n \nThe trail is in generally good condition, and spectacular views can be seen from all directions as the trail climbs to the 5723 foot summit.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nVerlot Campground offers standard sites, accommodating both tent and RV camping. Picnic tables, flush toilets and drinking water are also available, however there are no electrical hook-ups.<br/><br/> \n\nAccess to the Stillaguamish River and Benson Creek is available from the campground.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest offers visitors the chance to discover, or rediscover nature on a personal level.  Rugged peaks, scenic rivers, and interesting wildlife define the forest and surrounding designated wilderness areas.<br/><br/> \n\nOn a clear day visitors will see Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area.  Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano from which the forest takes its name is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers.  Mt. Baker's summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.<br/><br/>\nOn the banks of the Stillaguamish River, visitors can explore a unique ecosystem typical of the area.  Old-growth forests line the wide, gently-flowing river, known for its salmon run.  Populations of chinook, coho, chum, pink, and sockeye spawn in the river and its tributaries.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nVisit or stay in one of the historic lookouts in the area.  Lookouts are tangible symbols of Forest Service heritage, perched on high peaks with unobstructed views, where they have been used throughout the years to detect and control fires in remote wildlands.<br/><br/> \n\nTake some time to visit nearby Mount Rainer National Park. Considered a wonderland, the park offers a fantastic glimpse into glaciers, subalpine ecology, and volcanic landscapes typical in the region.<br/><br/>\n\nDiscover the Verlot Public Service Center, near the South Fork Stillaguamish River. Built by the Civilian Conservation Corps from 1933 to 1942, Verlot`s handsome buildings reflect the architectural style and fine craftsmanship of that era and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n<h2>contact_info</h2>\nFor facility specific information, please call (360) 386-8214.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

Olallie Lake (240 arces in size) has non-motorized boating and excellent fishing. Rental row boats are available at the nearby Olallie Resort. The lake is stocked with rainbow trout. Swimming is allowed in all lakes except Olallie Lake. Some of the trails and most of the graveled roads are open for mountain biking.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The four-room guard station has a kitchen, living room with two futon couches, a bunk bedroom and a loft with a queen bed.

It offers guests a wonderful spot to take in \nthe scenery and enjoy a multitude of recreational activities in the Northern Cascade Range.<br/><br/>\n\nSites are nestled in a mixed conifer forest on the banks of the scenic North Fork Skykomish River and its tributary, Troublesome Creek. Water is abundant in this area, \noffering visitors easy access to fishing, kayaking, and swimming. Guests will be lulled to sleep by its subtle, but ever-present gurgle.<br/><br/>\n\nThis campground is ideal for escaping the hustle of everyday life to enjoy time with friends and family.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nAt the campground, Troublesome Creek is a delight for exploring. A footbridge crosses the bubbling creek beneath towering pine and fir trees. For guests wanting to relax at the water's edge, or children searching for newness in nature, this is an ideal spot without even leaving the campground.<br/><br/> \n\nThe adjacent North Fork Skykomish River offers fishing for steelhead and salmon.<br/><br/>\n\nFor those wanting to venture further, the Beckler Peak Trail may be included on the agenda. Located 10 miles from the town of Skykomish, this trail is challenging, but worth the effort, offering hikers the opportunity to view the diverse landscapes of the area from a variety of perspectives.<br/><br/>  \n\nAt the Jennifer Dunn Trailhead, the trail starts out on a decommissioned logging road, and climbs through young alder and vine maple to an expansive vista of the Skykomish Valley. The trail continues to switchback through huge trees and by the remains of a trapper's cabin. Climbing higher, and upon reaching the final ridge top through steep alpine forest, hikers will be in awe of the panoramic view of near and distant peaks.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nTroublesome Creek Campground offers standard sites, accommodating both tent and RV camping. Tent-only sites are available as well.<br/><br/>\n\nThe campground is equipped with picnic tables, vault toilets and drinking water. No electrical hook-ups are available. Firewood may be available for purchase.<br/><br/> \n\nAccess to the Skykomish River is available from the campground, and several sites are near the river's edge.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest showcases rugged peaks, sparkling alpine lakes, and old-growth forests, providing visitors with unique and surprising \nlandscapes.<br/><br/>\n\nMt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area, dominates the landscape on a clear day. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active \nvolcano from which the forest takes its name is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker's summit, Grant Peak, is \nactually a mound of ice 1,300 feet deep, which hides a massive volcanic crater.<br/><br/>\n\nWildlife in the area includes mountain goats traversing the higher elevations, to coyotes and pine marten in the forests. Migratory birds and native fish find ample \nhabitat in the varied ecosystems as well. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to \nlive.\n<h2>contact_info</h2>\nFor facility specific information, please call (360) 386-8214.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

Adams Wilderness are all within easy driving distance and boast scenic vistas.<br/><br/> \n\nAtkisson Sno-Park is approximately 2.5 miles from the cabin and serves as a portal to the forest's network of 95 miles of groomed snowmobile trails. Three signed, ungroomed cross-country ski loops also depart from the Atkisson Sno-Park, offering loop opportunities of 4 to 11 miles. Portions of these loops overlap with each other and the snowmobile trail network.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Peterson Cabin accommodates up to six guests. The rustic cabin's lower floor has an accessible bedroom with a double bed, a kitchen area and living/dining room with two loveseats and a fireplace/wood stove insert. Propane lighting and heating are provided throughout. The kitchen is equipped with a propane cook top, stove, and refrigerator, pots and pans, dishes and utensils, as well as a dining table and four chairs. An outdoor picnic table and vault toilet are on-site. Firewood is provided.  <br>No water is available during from October through Spring; guests must bring plenty for drinking, cooking and washing. In the summer months potable water is available.    <br>Although the cabin has several amenities, guests do need to provide their own sleeping bags, linens, towels, dish soap, matches, first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. Bringing an additional light source in case of emergencies is also advised.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nA dense canopy of Douglas fir towers over the cabin and huckleberry bushes are thick in the understory.<br/><br/>\n\nNearby Mt. Adams Wilderness is dominated by its namesake peak. At an elevation of 12,276 feet, Mount Adams looms over at least ten glaciers, forested slopes and subalpine meadows.<br/><br/> \n\nWildlife in the area is abundant, including spotted owls, black tail deer, Roosevelt elk and black bear. The more elusive cougar, bobcat and pine marten are seen occasionally.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nGuler Ice Cave is one mile west of the cabin. It is filled with spectacular ice formations that resemble stalactites, stalagmites, columns, fans and boxwork. The ice is believed to form because the cave acts as a trap, retaining the heavy cold air that settles into the cave in winter. As the snow melts above, moisture dripping into the cave forms into ice columns and masses. The cave is about 650 feet long, with four sections separated by three ceiling collapses.<br/><br/>\n\nThe Forest Service has built a stairway down to the cave, but the steps can be slippery during winter. When exploring the cave, wear warm clothing, boots and a helmet. Use crampons if you have them. Have three sources of light.<br/><br/>\n\nWinter access requires cross-country skis, snowshoes or snowmobile. Many of the ice formations are just inside the cave entrance, so it's not necessary to explore deep inside.",

Lodgepole Meadow was used as a remote guard station for the early Forest Service crews working in the area. \n<br/><br/>\nDuring WWII, Herb and Zella Wright, a husband and wife lookout team, lived throughout the winter high up on the Blue Rock Lookout several miles away watching for enemy aircraft. Lodgepole Guard Station served as their base camp.\n<br/><br/>\nToday, Lodgepole Guard Station is a perfect destination for horse enthusiasts, families, couples or large groups looking for a unique camping experience in the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe meadow offers plenty of room and even terrain for a large group of visitors to spread out, camp, horseback ride, hike, mountain bike or just relax.\n<br/><br/>\nAdditional horseback riding trails are a short trailer ride away, and include the Alta Lake, Middle Fork and Seven Lakes Trails, all of which lead into the Sky Lakes Wilderness.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nConsidered to be an outstanding example of Civilian Conservation Corps construction in the Pacific Northwest, the one story cabin offers a large living room, kitchen and bathroom.

The large grassy meadow has a long history of being a major grazing area for horses and cattle, and that tradition continues today.\n<br/><br/> \nDiverse landscapes of the Rogue River Siskiyou National Forest provide habitat for a wide-range of wildlife in the area, including spotted owls and bull elk to salamanders and salmon. These species, along with many others, depend on the surrounding undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed wetlands, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nVisit Crater Lake National Park and learn about its unique natural and cultural history.

Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest sits on the west side of the Cascades in Washington, showcasing glacier-covered peaks, wide mountain meadows and old-growth forests, rich in history and outdoor opportunities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest boasts 1,500 miles of trails. From smooth paths meandering through deep quiet forests to challenging ascents up boulder-studded mountains, opportunities abound for every skill level. Access to biking, rafting and fishing is also readily available.<br/><br/>\n\nThe nearby Frog Lake Trail is a short nature hike, climbing steadily up the side of the hill, with views of Clear Creek far below.

Baker's summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.<br/><br/>\n\nAlong the banks of the Sauk River an outstanding show of wildflowers in July and August includes paintbrush, phlox, tiger lilies, aster, columbine and lupine. During the summer salmon and steelhead appear in abundance as they head up the river to spawn.<br/><br/>\n  \n\nThe surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests support an abundance of wildlife. In addition to being home to a multitude of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles, the area sustains more rare species such as lynx, moose, wolves and wolverine.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nVisitors enjoy the North Cascades and Mt.

For the remainder of the year, it is staffed by Forest Service personnel.   \n\nThis rugged, winter destination awaits the most enthusiastic outdoor adventurers as it is only accessible by foot, snowshoes or cross-country skis.

Travel into remote locations in the winter requires experience and advance preparation. Expect windy conditions.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nHiking, wildlife viewing, stargazing, snowshoeing and skiing are popular activities. Hager Mountain is used during fire season to keep watch over the surrounding flat lands for any sign of smoke.

The lookout is perched on the bald cap rocks that make up this mountain and offers 360 degree views as far as Mount Hood and Mount Shasta on a clear day.<br/><br/>\n\nSurrounded by towering snow-capped peaks, volcanic landscapes and wide-open sage basins, the area is known for scenic vistas and wild places where guests can still find solitude.",

Rujada is a perfect setting for family reunions, parties or group getaways.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nIn addition to being a prime location for hiking and biking in summer and early fall. The large grassy field is perfect for group activities or sports, and a playground and horseshoe pit are also provided on-site.\n<br/><br/>\nHikers will enjoy a moderately challenging hike on Swordfern Trail, leaving from the historic Civilian Conservation Corps Campground Register booth, located in the Rujada Picnic Area. The trail parallels the south side of Layng Creek, traveling through a stand of second growth Douglas fir and lush swordfern understory, then climbs to an abandoned logging road. Eventually it loops back to the Rujada Picnic area, or continues on the logging road and back into the camping loop. \n<br/><br/>\nIn autumn, visitors will be treated to the brilliant fall colors of the hardwood trees along Layng Creek.\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThis day use area has two reservable picnic sites. Each site can accommodate up to 30 people, and groups of up to 60 may reserve both sites.  \n\nThe sites are equipped with picnic tables and grills. Flush toilets and drinking water are provided.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nVisitors to Umpqua National Forest are often taken aback by the unique landscapes of southwestern Oregon. Explosive geologic events have shaped the distinctive landscape on the nearly 1 million-acre forest, and provide spectacular scenery as well as an abundance of natural and cultural resources.    \n\nThe translation of the word, \"Umpqua,\" meaning \"thundering waters,\" defines the area. High mountain lakes, heart-stopping rapids, peaceful ponds and thundering waterfalls, including the 272-foot Watson Falls on the North Umpqua Highway, provide plenty of pastimes for visitors.    \n\nDiverse ecosystems support a wide range of habitat for wildlife common to the area. From eagles and owls, to salamanders and salmon, these species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests to live.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nNearby are three spectacular waterfall trails. Spirit Falls is a short 0.4-mile, more difficult hike to a 60’ waterfall. Moon Falls is an easy, 0.5-mile hike to a 125’ cascading waterfall. Pinard Falls is a 0.6-mile, more difficult hike to a 105’ waterfall. All three hikes are within 10 miles of the campground and can be done within a single day. Visitors enjoy taking a picnic lunch and eating at the base of Moon Falls at a picnic table made and installed by a modern day Conservation Corps crew.",

The main attraction at Mount Rainier National Park is the mountain itself, a glacier-clad volcano of immense proportions. At 14,411 feet, it dominates the skyline for hundreds of miles. Visitors travel through majestic old-growth forest, past tumbling waterfalls and historic buildings to reach sub-alpine meadows, where world-famous wildflower displays are seen through July and August. Popular activities in the park include sight-seeing, hiking, rock climbing and camping.<br><br>The Cougar Rock area is located at an elevation of 3,180 feet. Summers are dry and cool with daytime temperatures in the 60 to 80-degree range.

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nThis facility is the group site at Ohanapecosh Campground. Ohanapecosh, on the southeast side of Mount Rainier National Park, is surrounded by old growth forest and crossed by an exceptionally beautiful snow-fed river. Close to Ohanapecosh are popular hikes to Silver Falls and the Grove of the Patriarchs.\n<br/><br/>\nThe main attraction at Mount Rainier National Park is the mountain itself, a glacier-clad volcano of immense proportions. At 14,411 ft., it dominates the skyline for hundreds of miles. Visitors travel through majestic old-growth forests, past tumbling waterfalls and historic buildings to reach sub-alpine meadows, where world-famous wildflower displays are seen in July and August. Popular activities in the park include sight-seeing, hiking, climbing and camping.\n<br/><br/>\nOhanapecosh campground has an elevation of 1,914 feet. Weather is dry, cool and sunny in the summer with daytime temperatures in the 60 to 80-degree range. Even though the eastern side of the park can be sunnier than other areas, weather can be variable and visitors should come prepared.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe most popular campground in the park, Ohanapecosh is convenient to both the Paradise and Sunrise areas. Numerous hiking trails originate both in and nearby the facility, including the Grove of the Patriarchs trail, which leads hikers through stands of old growth forest, and several trails that lead to Silver Falls waterfall. For visitors who would like to learn more about natural and cultural history, the Ohanapecosh Visitor Center is close by.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThere are two group sites. Both have tent-only camping, and each can fit up to 25 people. Drinking water is provided. Visitors must use extra caution with food storage, as bear and other animals inhabit the area around the campground.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nOhanapecosh is thought to be a Taidnapam Indian word for \"standing on the edge\" of the Ohanapecosh River. The river itself is lined with mossy boulders and drains cold, clear water from higher elevations. Its banks are lined with thick, old growth Douglas fir trees and other evergreens. There is no direct view of Mt. Rainier from the campground, but the mountain dominates the landscape in nearby areas of the park.",

One of the prominent peaks in the Selkirk Range still bears the name Roothaan. In 1865, Captain John Mullan designated this same lake as Kaniksu Lake on one of his maps. It is believed that \"Kaniksu\" was the Indian name of Black Robe, although this has never been authenticated. The name was gradually changed in the early 1900's from Kaniksu Lake to its present name of Priest Lake, which refers to the early-day Jesuit missionary priests who had established a base camp at Kalispell Bay in the 1840's. The lake is one of three largest and most beautiful lakes in the Idaho Panhandle, and a very popular recreation attraction. The world's largest Makinaw trout was caught here in 1963. Dolly Varden, Cutthroat, and Kokanee are also caught in the lake. It is now illegal to fish for Dolly Varden and they are to be returned to the lake when caught.<br/><br/>Upper Priest Lake is part of the Upper Priest Lake Scenic Area. There were five small parcels of private land totaling about 420 acres on Upper Priest Lake. The Forest Service purchased these tracts in 1967 with the assistance of Nature Conservancy. The entire shoreline of Upper Priest Lake is now in either the State of Idaho or Federal ownership, and is administered as a scenic area.<br/><br/>Upper Priest River, which flows into Upper Priest Lake, is one of the rivers to be studied for inclusion in the Wild and Scenic Rivers system along with the lower Priest River which was famous in the early days as a log-drive stream. The first recorded drive was in 1901 and the last in 1949. The greatest drive took place in 1931 when 50,000 cedar poles and 125,000,000 board feet or logs were herded down the river by the \"river pigs\".</p>",

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nNestled in a forest canopy of pine and fir on the banks of Icicle Creek,  Icicle Group Campground in Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest offers a peaceful setting for groups and large gatherings.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nIcicle Group Campground offers outdoor enthusiasts the opportunity to hike, fish, bike and enjoy a long list of outdoor recreational activities throughout the year. This campground has plenty of trails to explore by bike. Anglers may want to cast a line into the deep pools at nearby Toketie Lake. Populations of rainbow and cutthroat trout find habitat in this somewhat secluded lake.   The nearby Fourth of July Trail offers hikers expansive ridge line views and challenging terrain. Beginning in the forest at 4,000 feet, the trail quickly climbs in elevation, out of the trees into more open, arid landscapes. The trail continues, traversing through mountain meadows with spectacular views of the Stuart Mountain Range and Icicle Valley. At 10.6 miles, this is a solid day hike, though backpackers can hook up connecting trails to continue for multiple days though adjacent wilderness settings.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nIcicle Group Campground has one large site that can accommodate up to 30 guests and six vehicles. It is for walk-in tent camping only.  Guests must bring their own drinking water.  Portable toilets will be provided.  A wagon will be furnished for the transportation of tents and equipment.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nOkanogan-Wenatchee National Forest offers stunning scenic views, with high, glaciated alpine peaks, valleys of old growth forest and rugged shrub-steppe country making up the diverse landscape. Elevations range from below 1,000 feet to over 9,000 feet.<br/><br/>  \n  \nMore than 700 lakes and mountain ponds dot the glacier-carved terrain of nearby Alpine Lake Wilderness. Tree-covered valleys give way to rocky ridges and rugged peaks along the crest of the Cascades. Many peaks and slopes are permanently cloaked in snowfields. From wet forests of Douglas fir, cedar, and an understory of salal and berries, to firs and mountain hemlock, the landscape opens up to expansive meadows matted with low growth and ends with dry forestland of ponderosa pine and grasses.<br/><br/>  \n  \nCongress designated the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in 1976 with a total of 362,789 acres. Prior to designation, aggressive mining and logging operations punched numerous access roads into the area, creating a wildly irregular boundary to this popular area.\n\n<h2>contact_info</h2>\nFor facility specific information, please call (509) 548-3232.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nVisitors enjoy the North Cascades and Mt. Rainer National Parks, where interpretive programs and exhibits offer education about the diverse landscape and history of the area.  Guests can also explore the area's colorful railroad and mining history at the Steven's Pass Historic District, or hit the slopes at Steven's Pass Ski Area.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Group Sites</p>\n<p>Group Facility (including Cabins and Lookouts): A visitor who cancels a group overnight facility reservation less than 14 days before the arrival date will pay a $10.00 service fee AND forfeit the first night's use fee.</p>\n\n<p>No-Shows</p>\n<p>A no-show visitor is one who does not arrive at a campground and does not cancel the reservation by check-out time on the day after the scheduled arrival date. Staff will hold a campsite until check-out time on the day following the arrival date.</p>\n\n<p>No-shows are assessed $20.00 service fee and forfeit the first night's rate, taxes and applicable add-on for a campsite.  </p>\n\n<p>Refunds</p>\n<p>Visitors may submit a refund request through their Recreation.gov profile within 7 days of the end date of their reservation. Refunds will not be issued after the 7 days has ended.</p>\n\n<p>Refunds for debit or credit card payments will be issued as a credit to the original bank or credit card used to pay.</p>\n\n<p>For check or cash purchases, Recreation.gov will mail a Treasury check for refunds of cash, check, or money order payments to the address associated with the reservation. Treasury check refunds may take up to 6-8 weeks to arrive. </p>\n\n<p>In the event of an emergency closure, the Recreation.gov team or facility manager will refund all fees and will attempt to notify you using the contact information within the Recreation.gov visitor profile.</p>\n\n",

Built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930's, the cabin was originally used as an outpost to fight forest fires.   \n\nThe cabin is an ideal setting for relaxation and recreation, and is available for reservation from April to October.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nFall River Guard Station is a prime location for fishing, swimming and hiking in summer and early fall.<br/><br/> \n\nAnglers will enjoy casting a line into Fall River, located just steps from the cabin. The river is open only to fly-fishing, is an outstanding contributor of brown trout to the Deschutes River and provides excellent winter habitat for numerous species. Brook, brown and rainbow trout inhabit the river, and native whitefish can be found below the falls.<br/><br/>\n\nAccess to Fall River Trail is available from the guard station, winding through lodgepole and ponderosa pine along the river.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThis rustic, 600-square-foot, single story cabin was constructed in the Cascadia style of the Pacific Northwest Region. It has two bedrooms, a kitchen and a living room. The cabin is furnished with one full bed, a twin bed and a two-person futon in the living room. Cabin amenities include a heater, refrigerator, lights and stove, all powered by propane. The kitchen is furnished with cooking utensils, pots and pans.

A vault toilet is located on the premises.  \n\nRV camping is allowed on-site. <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nA forest of lodgepole pine provides the backdrop for this area, with the beautiful, spring-fed Fall River flowing adjacent to the cabin. Clear and cold, it originates two miles northwest of Pringle Falls and winds its way northeast to join the mighty Deschutes River.<br/><br/>\n\nTowering nearby peaks, designated wilderness and remnants of volcanic activity in the area showcase ecosystems typical of central Oregon.<br/><br/>\n\nWildlife in the area abounds, including deer, native fish and migratory birds. These species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests to live.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nLava Lands Visitor Center in Bend, Oregon, and the unique geological landscape of Newberry National Volcanic Monument draw visitors to the region.  \n\n\nVisitors may also enjoy traveling the Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway.

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nCottonwood Cabin is located in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, Entiat Ranger District in central Washington's Entiat Valley, on the banks of the Entiat River at an elevation of 3,100 feet. Constructed in the 1940s as administrative housing, the facility and on-site barn and corral were used seasonally by Forest Service fire, trail and campground crew personnel.\n<br/><br/>\nToday the cabin offers visitors a wonderful setting for recreation and relaxation from June through October in the forested mountain terrain of the Entiat Ranger District.  The cabin can be reached by standard passenger vehicles over gravel roads.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nGuests at Cottonwood Cabin will find that the surrounding area offers opportunities to hike, fish, mountain bike and enjoy a long list of outdoor recreational activities throughout the year.\n<br/><br/> \nAnglers will enjoy casting a line into the Entiat River above Entiat Falls. The cabin is located four miles above the falls. Carving through a wide, U-shaped valley, the river is dominated by relatively shallow riffles interspersed with pools, plunge pools and glides where the trout fishing is quite good. Populations of rainbow trout, Cutthroat trout, and Eastern brook trout are found in this tributary.  Selective gear rules apply to fishing in the Entiat River. See Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife for fishing rules and regulations.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe one room cabin (20' x 16') can accommodate four people at a time. Amenities include hot and cold running water (summer months only), propane cook stove, wall heater, refrigerator, and LED lights.\n<br/><br/>\nFurnishings include a dining table, lounge chair, futon sofa that coverts to a double bed, and a separate double bed. The small kitchen area is supplied with basic pots, pans, silverware and plates.\n<br/><br/> \nOutdoors, a private shower facility, picnic table, campfire ring and pit toilet are provided. An area for pitching one tent is also on site. Wood may be available, but the supply cannot be guaranteed.\n<br/><br/>\nGuests must bring several of their own amenities as the cabin does not provide food, sleeping bags/bedding, towels, dish soap, matches, a first aid kit, toilet paper or garbage bags.  \n<br/><br/> \nThe light system is solar powered. Although lighting is provided, visitors are encouraged to bring additional light sources. Cabin water is provided by pressurized solar water for summer months.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest offers stunning scenic vistas, with high, glaciated alpine peaks, valleys of old growth forest and rugged shrub-steppe country making up the diverse landscape. Elevations range from below 1,000 feet to more than 9,000 feet. The surrounding forest provides excellent habitat for a wide range of wildlife. Precipitation varies greatly throughout the area, ranging from approximately 140 inches along the Cascade Crest to only 10 inches along the eastern edge. Visitors can expect many days of warm, sunny weather in the summer, and winters with clear skies and plenty of snow.\n<br/><br/>\nNestled in a mature lodge pole pine and spruce forest, the area surrounding the cabin is home to abundant wildlife, including mule deer, cougars, native fish, black bears, pine marten, moose, bald and golden eagles and a variety of woodpeckers and owls.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe Silver Falls National Recreation Trail is a 1.8 mile hike beneath towering cedar and pines, along Silver Creek to the base of Silver Falls. Along the way, hikers are treated to views of the 141-foot cascade, as well as the Entiat valley below, and the mountains above.  Beautiful stone staircases and bridges along the trail offer many stopping points to take the perfect photograph.\n<br/><br/>\nAt Entiat River Road mile marker 27.8 is Box Canyon. This geological formation is about 65 million years in the making and the chasm spans a run of about 500 feet and ranges from 75-150 ft. deep. Fish Tail Falls can be observed from the view point running over, under and through a pile of large boulders, cascading another 15 feet. At times you can see salmon in this pool.\n<br/><br/>\nAt mile marker 32.2 on Entiat River Road is Entiat Falls. This broad 25 foot cascading natural waterfall makes quite a rejuvenating impression. Bring a picnic lunch or just stretch your legs and enjoy. Take precaution as river rock can be very slick.\n<br/><br/>\nCooper's Store and Cafe in Ardenvoir is approximately 28 miles down valley and is the nearest source of gasoline, groceries, miscellaneous camping supplies and telephone services.",

During the rest of the year, it is on a first-come, first-served basis. During winter (November - April), some campground loops are closed, but camping is still available. </p>\n<p>Kalaloch Campground is located on the southwest coast of the Olympic Peninsula in Olympic National Park, on a high bluff adjacent to the Pacific Ocean. Although campsites are not directly on the beach, several of them overlook the water and there is beach access within the facility. The campground is large and set amidst a peaceful, coastal forest that thrives on the region's high annual rainfall. Rain or shine, it is one of the most visited areas of the park.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nNear the campground and lodge, trails and steps descend about 40 ft. to the beach. There are several beaches, tide pools, scenic overlooks and trails to explore. The Kalaloch Creek Nature Trail is a mile-long walk through the forest along Kalaloch Creek, which drains into the ocean. There are accessible lookout points at Ruby Beach and Beach Trail 4.\n<br/><br/>\nKalaloch is known for birding; species such as western gulls and bald eagles are frequently sighted. Visitors may even spot a puffin. Fishing and shellfish harvesting is allowed under state and park regulations.\n<br/><br/>\nSwimming is possible, however the Kalaloch area is known for large drifting logs that can pose a threat to swimmers as they wash ashore. Swimmers should also be aware of potentially dangerous rip tides.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Kalaloch Campground is a large facility with 168 campsites, including one group site and four accessible sites. Each site has campfire rings with grates and picnic tables. Food lockers and drinking water are available at campground loop restrooms. There are no hookups at this facility, though a dump station is available for a $10 fee ($5 with a Senior or Access Pass) and is not included in the camping fee. The nearest shower facility is five miles away, and campers can purchase firewood and other goods at a nearby general store.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nKalaloch has no shortage of natural areas to explore. The Pacific shoreline just below provides ample habitat for marine life: tide pools reveal crabs and sea urchins at low tide; sea otters float on the surface of submerged kelp beds; shorebirds nest on beaches; and whales and dolphins occasionally emerge offshore. Beyond the national park's 73 miles of coastline lie three national wildlife refuges and one marine sanctuary.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nOlympic National Park has much to explore, including temperate rain forests, ocean shores, sub-alpine mountains, lakes and more. The lush Hoh Rain Forest, as well as the towns of Queets, Quinault and Forks are within a 45-minute drive.\n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/olym/planyourvisit/visiting-the-hoh.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Visiting the Hoh Rain Forest</a>\n<br/><br/>\n<a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/olym/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Olympic National Park</a>",

Close to Ohanapecosh are popular hikes to Silver Falls and the Grove of the Patriarchs.\n<br/><br/>\nThe main attraction at Mount Rainier National Park is the mountain itself, a glacier-clad volcano of immense proportions. At 14,411 ft., it dominates the skyline for hundreds of miles. Visitors travel through majestic old-growth forests, past tumbling waterfalls and historic buildings to reach sub-alpine meadows, where world-famous wildflower displays are seen in July and August. Popular activities in the park include sight-seeing, hiking, climbing and camping.\n<br/><br/>\nOhanapecosh campground has an elevation of 1,914 feet. Weather is dry, cool and sunny in the summer with daytime temperatures in the 60 to 80-degree range. Even though the eastern side of the park can be sunnier than other areas, weather can be variable and visitors should come prepared.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe most popular campground in the park, Ohanapecosh is convenient to both the Paradise and Sunrise areas. Numerous hiking trails originate both in and nearby the facility, including the Grove of the Patriarchs trail, which leads hikers through stands of old growth forest, and several trails that lead to Silver Falls waterfall. <br/><br/>\nFor visitors who would like to learn more about natural and cultural history, the Ohanapecosh Visitor Center is close by as well.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThis large campground has 188 individual sites for RV or tent camping situated among the ancient trees. There is drinking water, but no electric hookups. Visitors must use extra caution with food storage, as bear and other animals inhabit the area around the campground.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nOhanapecosh is thought to be a Taidnapam Indian word for \"standing on the edge\" of the Ohanapecosh River. The river itself is lined with mossy boulders and drains cold, clear water down from higher elevations. Its banks are lined with thick, old growth Douglas fir trees and other evergreens.

Stone walls built in the Basque tradition still ascend the mesa.  Remnants of a waterwheel hint at the lush alfalfa fields fed through the gravity irrigation system. Nineteen buildings and structures at the ranch contribute to the property's designation as a historical rural landscape on the Department of the Interior's National Register of Historic Places.                 \n<h2>Know Before You Go:</h2> \n<ul><li> Open YEAR ROUND, best access May-October. </li>\n<li> Accessibility is dependent on road conditions.

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nPerched atop its namesake mountain at an elevation of 5,587 feet, Evergreen Mountain Lookout was built in 1935 for detecting wildfires. During fire season, lookouts stayed \nin the cabin, watching for lightning strikes and forest fires in the Skykomish drainage. Once the lookout located a fire or smoke, he or she would radio to the \nSkykomish Ranger Station and give local landmarks to help firefighters locate the fire quickly.   \n\nDuring World War II, Evergreen Mountain Lookout was used as an Aircraft Warning Station, and then remained an active fire tower until the early 1980s. During \nvolunteer restoration efforts in the 1990s, the lookout was placed on the National Register of Historic Places.  \n\nThe lookout tower is located in the Wild Sky Wilderness and must be accessed via a steep, scenic hike on the  Evergreen Lookout Trail .\nSome amenities are provided, but guests should be prepared to pack in many of their own supplies.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nHiking, birding and wildlife viewing are popular activities around the lookout.<br/><br/>\n\nGuests access the lookout via the Evergreen Lookout Trail that climbs steeply through the old Evergreen Mountain Burn of 1967. \nHikers enter dense forest, where the grade eases a bit upon reaching a small saddle below the lookout. At this point, the trail \nascends again to reach the building. The trail is noted for \nwildflowers, scenery and wildlife.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe 14x14-ft. lookout cabin sleeps four and is furnished with one twin-sized bed and mattress, three extra mattresses, a table and chairs, propane stove, two battery powered lanterns, a cooking pot, dishes and a coffee pot. A primitive vault toilet is located several hundred feet down the ridge from the lookout.  \n\nThere is no water or heat at the site.  Guests must bring water for drinking, cooking and washing.    \n\nGuests must also bring flashlights, sleeping bags, towels, dish soap, matches, a first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. All trash and food\nmust be packed out, and guests are expected to clean the cabin before leaving.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nOn a clear day, guests at Evergreen Mountain Lookout see views of Glacier Peak, Mt. Daniels, Keyes Peak, Columbia Glacier, Mt. Rainier and parts of the Henry M. Jackson Wilderness.  \nRemains of the last big fire spotted on Evergreen Mountain in 1967 are still evident on the rocky south face of the ridge to within several hundred feet of \nthe lookout.<br/><br/>\n\nEvergreen Mountain Lookout is situated within the Wild Sky Wilderness area. Wildlife is abundant, and guests may catch a glimpse of black bears, bobcat,\nelk or bald eagle. Wolves are making a comeback to the area, but they are usually heard and not seen.",

First by the Molalla and Kalapuya tribes; in the 1800s by the European hunters and explorers and then by immigrants on wagon trains staking claims along the river. The route travels through the lower 34 miles of the 80-mile McKenzie River. It connects the I-5 corridor to two Nationally Designated Scenic Byways (McKenzie Pass-Santiam Pass and the West Cascades).</p><p>The scenic views provide an enjoyable transition from the broad agricultural plain of the lower McKenzie Valley – then heading up the narrower river canyon scenery between Vida and Blue River – before transitioning again to the more rural and wild forested lands of the upper Valley. Travelers along the McKenzie River Scenic Byway will not only experience the iconic charm of one of the Pacific Northwest’s most beautiful landscapes but also have many opportunities to learn how the area’s unique geology and hydrology support a rich habitat of flora, fauna, and fish.</p><p><a href=\"http://links.govdelivery.com:80/track?type=click&enid=ZWFzPTEmbXNpZD0mYXVpZD0mbWFpbGluZ2lkPTIwMTgwNTAzLjg5MzA5NjExJm1lc3NhZ2VpZD1NREItUFJELUJVTC0yMDE4MDUwMy44OTMwOTYxMSZkYXRhYmFzZWlkPTEwMDEmc2VyaWFsPTE4MzA2OTE4JmVtYWlsaWQ9ZGlzYWFjc29uQGZzLmZlZC51cyZ1c2VyaWQ9ZGlzYWFjc29uQGZzLmZlZC51cyZ0YXJnZXRpZD0mZmw9JmV4dHJhPU11bHRpdmFyaWF0ZUlkPSYmJg==&&&106&&&http://www.journalgraphicsdigitalpublications.com/epubs/MEDIAMERICA/ScenicByWaysGuide2016/viewer/desktop/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oregon Scenic Byways Official Driving Guide</a></p>",

Its proximity to high alpine lakes, lush forests and towering peaks in nearby wilderness areas make it a popular destination for individual and group camping excursions.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nPopular activities in the area include hiking, fishing and motorized boating in the summer months, as well as cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in the winter.\n<br/><br/>\nNumerous hiking and horseback riding trails can be accessed from the campground and in the surrounding area. The 3.2-mile Suttle Lake Loop Trail meanders through the developed recreation areas on Suttle Lake. The trail follows the wooded shoreline of the lake, providing opportunities for fishing or picnicking along the way.\n<br/><br/>\nFor fishing, boats are most commonly used on Suttle Lake. Float tubes are adequate, and wading is possible in some areas. A few areas are fishable from shore. The lake sustains an excellent population of naturally reproducing kokanee, brown trout, whitefish and crayfish.\n<br/><br/>\nThe campground has a shallow boat ramp area, and most campsites have easy access to the waterfront. Motorized and non-motorized boats are allowed on Suttle Lake.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nBlue Bay Campground offers standard sites that accommodate both tents and RVs, but no hookups are available. Picnic tables and campfire rings with grills are provided, as are vault toilets and drinking water.\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nSuttle Lake is surrounded by mixed conifer forest. Its waters are deep and clear, formed in a terminal moraine, deposited by glacial ice about 25,000 years ago.\n<br/><br/>\nLake Creek flows eastward from Suttle Lake to the Metolius River. The clear, cold Metolius flows north from headwater springs through diverse coniferous forests and a volcanic landscape with extinct volcanoes, cinder cones, calderas and ancient lava flows.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nVisitors can explore wilderness areas, lakes, reservoirs, wild and scenic rivers and approximately 1,600 miles of trails that comprise nearly 2.5 million acres within the Deschutes National Forest and the adjacent Ochoco National Forest.",

Miner's Retreat is part of the Fremont Powerhouse complex, a hub for mining built in the early 1900s. It is one of four cabins located at the site near the town of Granite, and provides great flexibility for larger groups.\n<br/><br/>\nThe surrounding valleys once teemed with mining activity, primarily gold. The Fremont Powerhouse was built in 1908 as an economical method for mining. Two dams were constructed at Olive Lake, and water from the lake was piped through an 8-mile wood and steel pipeline to the powerhouse to generate electricity. Homes were constructed to shelter workers who monitored the pipeline. Today, these same shelters are where visitors can stay overnight.\n<br/><br/>\nThe cabin is uphill from the Fremont Powerhouse, flanked by Caretakers Cabin and Hilltop Hideaway. Winter access may require skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles.<br/><br/>                                    \n<a href=\"http://www.photographyoptions.net/images/usace/redrock/tour.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Click here</a> for a virtual tour of the area.<h2>Recreation</h2>\n Guests can hike on trails into the North Fork John Day Wilderness or go mountain biking on forest roads. A drive along the Blue Mountain Scenic Byway is a treat, as are other activities like huckleberry and mushroom picking, bird watching, wildlife viewing and photographing the vast landscape. Nearby Olive Lake offers boating, fishing and swimming.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThis cozy little cabin offers a covered front porch and features two bedrooms, a full bath with hot and cold running water (during the summer months only) and a kitchen and living room. The cabin has electric lights throughout and is heated with electric wall heaters. \n<br/><br/>\nThe cabin sleeps up to six and is fully furnished with beds, a couch and a table with chairs. The kitchen is equipped with an electric stove and oven, refrigerator and a variety of utensils, such as skillets, a coffee pot, glasses, cups, dishes and silverware. Cleaning supplies are also provided. Guests must bring sleeping bags or bedding, a flashlight, first aid kit, washcloths, towels and dish soap, among other general camping supplies. <a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/r6/recreation/rentals/uma-miners-retreat.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">Click here</a> for more cabin details.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe cabin sits at an elevation of about 5,000 feet, on a hillside overlooking the expansive Umatilla National Forest near the North Fork John Day Wilderness. A grassy lawn in front leads to the other three cabins in the area. The forest lies in the Blue Mountains and is home to Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir. \n<br/><br/>\nBirds in the area include the black-backed woodpecker, American kestrel and the Boreal owl. Black bear, elk and deer are among the native land mammals.  <a href=\"http://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/umatilla/home/?cid=STELPRDB5309506\" rel=\"nofollow\">Click here</a> to learn about bear safety.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe cabin is located less than 6 miles from Granite, Oregon, a ghost town that once bustled with prospectors and pioneers. The town provides groceries and fuel.",

The newly constructed cabin, which was completed in the summer of 2015, sits on the same footprint as its predecessor, which was destroyed during a forest fire in 2002. Through numerous donations of funding, materials, and volunteer labor, the cabin has been rebuilt and is now ready for you to enjoy. While the cabin is available year-round, off season access may be limited to foot or snowmobile depending on weather conditions, as the roads are not maintained in the winter.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nRecreational activities within close proximity of Fremont Point Cabin include horseback riding, wildlife viewing and photography, mountain biking, OHV riding, hunting, fishing, kayaking and boating. Numerous trails including the Fremont National Recreation Trail and Oregon Timber Trail are also nearby.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The large two-sided deck provides ample room to sit, relax and enjoy the vistas.

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nDeer Creek Guard Station is located approximately 31 miles from the town of John Day, in central Oregon. It is in a beautiful, quiet location, off the beaten path. From sunup to sundown, the cabin affords opportunities for adventure in exploring, viewing wildlife, or just relaxing and enjoying the wonders of nature all around. \n  \nThe cabin is larger than some, is furnished and offers many comforts. It can be accessed by vehicle. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nBig game hunting is popular in the area, as well as fishing on Deer Creek and South Fork John Day. Anglers might watch for coho, winter steelhead, spring chinook, fall chinook and cutthroat trout, among others in the area. \n  \nGuests can also enjoy hiking and horseback riding on a variety of trails in the area.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe rustic cabin has a living room/sleeping area, a small bedroom and a kitchen. The living/sleeping area is equipped with a propane fireplace for heat, a couch, chair and end tables. A Murphy bed is located in the living/sleeping area for additional sleeping space and can be put away during the day. \n<br/><br/>\nIn the dining area is a full futon bed and table with four chairs.

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nLocated in southwest Oregon in the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest, Hart-Tish Park is surrounded by a variety of landscapes, boasting nearby volcanic peaks, rivers and old-growth forests.\n<br/><br/>\nHart-Tish Park offers several acres of beautifully groomed lawn sloping down to the shores of Applegate Lake. Visitors can spot the peaks of the majestic Red Buttes Wilderness while looking south over the lake.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nHart-Tish Campground sits on the shores of Applegate Lake, a popular recreation lake located north of the Red Buttes Wilderness Area. Visitors enjoy swimming, cycling, boating, canoeing, fishing and hiking the various trails near the lake.\n<br/><br/> \nCollins Mountain Trail, named for two brothers who mined in this vicinity during the 1850s and 60s, begins at the Hart-Tish Park picnic area. The trail crosses Upper Applegate Road and drops down to Grouse Creek, where it passes an abandoned miners' cabin and several mine adits, as well as an an inactive Bigfoot trap.  Leaving Grouse Creek, the trail climbs steeply for one mile to the ridge top, gaining 1,000 foot elevation, and begins a long traverse of the western slope of Collins Mountain. \n<br/><br/> \nPanoramic views of Applegate Lake and the Siskiyou Crest are seen at several locations along the trail. \n<br/><br/> \nThe inactive Bigfoot trap, found at the beginning of the trail, was built in 1974 by the North American Wildlife Research Team. The trap was inspired by  a miner who lived near the Applegate River who claimed to have found 18-inch-long, human-like tracks in his garden. The organization operated the trap, keeping it baited with carcasses for six years, but caught only bears. Currently the Forest Service keeps an eye on the trap, but otherwise does not maintain it.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nHart-Tish Campground has seven traditional tent campsites and eight lakeside RV parking spots. All tent campsites are a short walk in of approximately 75 yards, with carts provided for transporting gear. The RV sites are a sectioned-off portion of the day-area use parking.  \nThe RV sites back-up directly to the lake shoreline. It's a beautiful setting, but there may be day-use car traffic in close proximity to the boat launch area. RV campers are allocated two parking spots to help accommodate slide-outs and extra gear.  \nDrinking water and flush toilets are available, as well as an on-site General Store.  \nKayak and Paddle Board rentals are available at $30 for 3-hrs or $45 all-day.  \nThis is also a boat ramp offered.  \nPlease note, there is a two-night minimum when you desire to reserve a Friday or Saturday night.\nPlease Note: There is NO INTERNET service at the Lake. We realize the error listed in campsite description, we are working on fixing that. <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe unique character of the landscapes comprising the area has led to the designation of over 340,000 acres of the forest as wilderness, and over 200 miles of streams as National Wild and Scenic Rivers.<br/><br/>\n\nThe forest itself is composed of two distinct geological provinces, the Cascade Range and the Siskiyou Mountains. The Cascade Range is dominated by snow-capped volcanic peaks like the 9,495-foot Mt. McLoughlin, located within the Sky Lakes Wilderness. \n<br/><br/> \nThe Siskiyou area embodies the most complex and treasured plant communities in the Pacific Northwest. World-class wild rivers, biological diversity, remarkable fisheries and complex watersheds all define the Siskiyou.<br/><br/> \n\nDiverse landscapes provide habitat for a wide range of wildlife, from spotted owls and bull elk to salamanders and sandhill cranes.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe nearby Rogue River National Recreation Trail, stretching 40 miles between Grave Creek and Big Bend, offers some of southwestern Oregon's most scenic landscapes and rewarding hiking experiences. This hiking-only trail follows the north bank of the Rogue River as it winds its way toward the Pacific Ocean.<br/><br/>  \n\nVisitors enjoy Crater Lake National Park and learning about its unique natural and cultural history.  At 1,943 feet deep, Crater Lake is the deepest lake in the United States and one of the ten deepest lakes in the world.",

By 1911, Ochoco Ranger Station was part of one of seven ranger districts on the newly formed Ochoco National Forest. The site quickly grew from a single office/residence building to a compound with an office, residence, storage building and barn. This house was constructed in 1940 specifically for the district ranger by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the US Forest Service. It showcases the rustic architectural styles common to this era.  \n\nThe scenic location of the Ochoco Ranger Rental offers easy access to Walton Lake, Big Summit Prairie and much of the Ochoco National Forest. This rental allows visitors to enjoy all the comforts of home in a beautiful, natural setting. This cabin is not available the first Wednesday of each month for water testing, cleaning and maintenance. <h2>Recreation</h2>\nThis house is a year-round rental, allowing visitors to participate in summer or winter recreation. The 8-mile Lookout Mountain Trail #804 begins at Ochoco Ranger Station and takes hikers to the top of Lookout Mountain.  \n\nNearby Walton Lake, a developed recreation site, is located about 7 miles northeast of Ochoco Ranger Station and offers an easy hike around the lake that also connects with the more difficult Round Mountain Trail.

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nThe Teanaway Guard Station is located in the Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest, north of Cle Elum, Washington. The cabin was originally constructed in 1950 by gold miner Archie Redding, who built the cabin near Mineral Springs, Washington. In 1978, Archie passed away and his cabin came into Forest Service possession. The cabin was then moved to its present location and used as a fire guard station intermittently until becoming available for reservation in 2004.  \n\nThe guard station sits at 3,200 feet elevation in the Teanaway River drainage with the icy North Fork Teanaway River just across the road. It is available for rent early May through mid-November and mid-December through early April. In warmer months, the cabin is accessible by car, but winter access is by ski, snowshoe or snowmobile over a 2.2-mile groomed snowmobile route.  \n\nSeveral amenities are provided at the cabin, but guests should be prepared to bring some of their own supplies and gear for a comfortable stay.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe nearby Ingalls Way Trail allows hikers to enjoy stunning views of Mt. Stuart and the Enchantments. Fishing is possible in nearby streams.   \n\nUp to 24 inches of snowfall in a 24 hour period is not uncommon in this area, making it a winter wonderland for cross-country skiing, backcountry skiing and snowboarding and snowshoeing.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The rustic 12x18-foot log cabin can sleep two people on a set of bunk beds with mattresses. Other amenities include table and chairs, a Coleman propane cook stove and a D battery operated lantern. The stove must be taken outside for use. No stoves or open flames are allowed in the cabin.   <br><br>A wood stove heats the cabin; however, wood must be split. An axe, splitting maul and wedge are available for guest use. A snow shovel is provided. A picnic table, fire pit and vault toilet are located outdoors.   <br><br>There is no water or electricity available at the site. Guests must bring water for drinking, cooking and washing. Water can be taken from the Teanaway River, but must be treated before drinking.   <br><br>Fuel and D-batteries are not provided for the propane stove or battery operated lantern. Guests must bring their own 16.4-ounce propane canisters and four D batteries, as well as cooking utensils, cookware, backup lighting, sleeping bags, towels, dish soap, matches, toilet paper and garbage bags. All trash and food must be packed out, and guests are expected to clean the cabin before leaving.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest is defined by its diverse landscapes, boasting high, glaciated alpine peaks, lush valleys of old-growth forest and rugged shrub-steppe country.  \n\nMore than 700 lakes and mountain ponds dot the glacier-carved terrain of nearby Alpine Lake Wilderness. Tree-covered valleys give way to rocky ridges and rugged peaks along the crest of the Cascades. Many peaks and slopes are permanently cloaked in snowfields. From wet forests of Douglas fir, cedar and mountain hemlock, the landscape opens up to expansive meadows and dry forests of ponderosa pine and grasses.  \n\nSeasonal changes envelop the area as snowmelt gives rise to springtime wildflowers, and autumn colors welcome a landscape blanketed with snow. The area surrounding the cabin is home to abundant wildlife, including deer, squirrels, black bears, mountain lions and migratory birds.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nMountain biking and hiking trails are located within 2 miles of the cabin.",

The lake is popular for swimming, cycling, boating, canoeing, fishing and hiking the various trails near the lake.</p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>Beaver Sulphur Group Campground offers a large, reservable group site that has individual spurs for tents and trailers. The site is equipped with picnic tables, campfire rings and vault toilets.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe unique character of the landscapes comprising the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest has led to the designation of over 340,000 acres of the forest as Wilderness, and over 200 miles of streams as National Wild and Scenic Rivers.<br/><br/>\n\nThe forest itself is composed of two distinct geological provinces, the Cascade Range and the Siskiyou Mountains.<br/><br/> \n\nThe Cascade Range is dominated by snow-capped volcanic peaks, such as 9,495 foot Mt. McLoughlin, located within the Sky Lakes Wilderness. The Siskiyou area embodies the most complex and treasured plant communities in the Pacific Northwest. World-class wild rivers, biological diversity, remarkable fisheries resources and complex watersheds define the Siskiyou.<br/><br/> \n\nDiverse landscapes provide habitat for a wide-range of wildlife, from spotted owls and bull elk to salamanders and sandhill cranes.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n\nThe United States Congress designated the Red Buttes Wilderness in 1984 and it now includes a total of 19,940 acres. Management of the Red Buttes Wilderness, located on the California/Oregon border, is shared by the Klamath National Forest and the Rogue River - Siskiyou National Forest. The majority of the Wilderness lies within the boundaries of the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest. Several lakes are accessible in the forest. Squaw Peak looks south to Squaw Lakes, a semi-primitive developed recreation area that accepts camping reservations from May through September. Applegate lake is a large reservoir with boat ramps, campgrounds, viewpoints and a developed recreation area named Hart tish. Both Squaw Lakes and Applegate lake are open for fishing year-round.\n\n",

The house is minimally furnished with a table and chairs, a sink and food preparation counter and a wood stove. There is no firewood available at this site, visitors must bring their own.\n  \nGuests must also provide their own sleeping bags, sleeping pads, a light source (battery powered lights are preferred), towels, dish soap, matches, cooking gear, first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags. Water is available on site from a hand pump. Solar lighting is available, though it is recommended that guests bring an additional light source (battery operated lights). The use of candles is prohibited.  \nTent space and room for trailer parking is available near the cabin.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe Ludlum House is somewhat secluded and surrounded by a towering old-growth forest, with an expanse of lawn stretching out before it. Within an 1.5 hour drive from the house, guests have access to the rugged southern Oregon and northern California coasts and further south, the <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/redw/index.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Redwood National Park</a>.\n<br/><br/>\nThe nearby Winchuck River flows into the Pacific Ocean about 0.5 miles north of the Oregon and California border and approximately 5 miles south of Brookings, Oregon. Five major tributaries, Wheeler Creek, East Fork, Fourth of July Creek, Bear Creek and South Fork, make up the Winchuck River system. Mt. Emily, at 2,926 feet, is the highest point in the basin.\n<br/><br/> \nDiverse landscapes provide habitat for a wide-range of wildlife, including black-tailed deer and an occasional black bear, to squirrels and salmon. Sensitive wildlife species such as Spotted Owl and Marbled Murrelet are present in the watershed as well. These species, along with many others, depend on the surrounding undeveloped wilderness, undisturbed wetlands, clean streams, and diverse forests to live.",

The Little Missouri National Grassland was once a part of the Custer National Forest, but is now a part of the Dakota Prairie Grasslands, a National Forest unit consisting entirely of  National Grasslands.

It is a mixed grass prairie, meaning it has both long and short grass.</p><p>The boundaries of the grasslands on certain maps can be misleading. Within the boundaries of the national grassland are significant portions of state-owned and privately owned land, much of it leased by cattle ranchers for grazing. Overall, in descending order of land area, it is located in parts of McKenzie, Billings, Slope, and Golden Valley counties.</p><p>White Butte, North Dakota's highest point, is located in the extreme southeast corner of the grassland, south of the town of Amidon.</p><p>The grassland is administered by the Forest Service as part of the Dakota Prairie Grasslands from offices in Bismarck, North Dakota.

It provides a year-round base camp from which guests can access thousands of acres of back country for skiing, hunting and exploration. Depending on the season, guests may also choose to enjoy the extensive system of quality mountain bike, horse and hiking trails that connect with the cabin.<br><br><br><br>The cabin is not accessible by vehicle and the area around the cabin is closed to all forms of motorized use. The winter route begins at the Kettle Crest Trailhead on Sherman Pass (State Highway 20) and has a one-way distance of approximately five miles for skiers and snowshoers. Winter visitors are advised to carry snow chains and a shovel in their vehicle as winter storms and icy conditions can make it difficult to exit the trailhead, even after it has been plowed. Hikers, bikers and horseback riders can access the cabin in the summer and fall from the Snow Peak Trailhead via the 3-mile Snow Peak Trail. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nIn addition to camping, visitors to the area enjoy hiking, mountain biking and horseback riding on a variety of trails in the area. The Snow Peak Trail No. 10, Kettle Crest South Trail No. 13, Sherman Loop Trail No. 72 and Edds Mountain Trail No. 3 can all be accessed from the cabin. Climbing, snowshoeing and skiing in the area are also popular. \n<br/><br/>\nVisitors also enjoy the area for hunting during open seasons, as the open mountain meadows throughout the area entice a variety of wildlife. The cabin is in a remote location and guests are advised to carry a topographic map of the area and a compass when leaving the cabin at any time.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The one-room 17-by-19 cabin has cots and foam pads to accommodate up to four people. It is also equipped with a propane cook stove, a table, basic cookware and cutlery, and a wood stove for heat. Solar-powered lighting and an outhouse are provided. Horse corrals are also available for equestrian campers and a spring fed water trough is located near the cabin along the Kettle Crest 13 South trail.<br> <br>Firewood is provided, but guests must split their own wood with an axe and tools that are provided. Firewood must be flown into the cabin by helicopter every two or three years, which is very expensive.  Guests are asked to use the firewood conservatively while heating the cabin. Given the size of the cabin and the efficiency of the wood stove, a little wood can go a long ways. In addition, firewood provided at the cabin is not to be used in any user created outdoor fire rings. <br> <br>Guests must bring their own water for drinking, cooking and cleaning purposes. Sleeping bags, toilet paper, garbage bags and food are also not provided. Cell phone service is not available in the area.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe cabin sits at an elevation of 6,400 feet, on a ridge in the Kettle River Mountain Range in the Colville National Forest. It was built through the cooperative efforts of the Snow Peak Shelter Alliance and the Colville National Forest. Construction took nearly three years and was completed in 1995. Views from the cabin stretch from the Cascades to the mountains of Canada and northern Idaho.\n  \nThe Kettle Range encompasses an area of 2,700 miles. The range runs north to south, bordered on the east by the Kettle River and the Columbia River, and on the west by the Kettle River, the Curlew Valley and the Sanpoil River. Wildlife in the area include hawks, bear and cougars.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n<p>The cabin is near trailheads, a picnic area and the Sherman Pass Scenic Byway. The popular highway runs 40 miles from the town of Republic to the west and the Columbia River to the east, passing through the center of the Kettle Range. It reaches its highest point, 5,575 feet, at Sherman Pass, the highest mountain pass open year-round in Washington state.</p>\n",

This campground has plenty of trails to explore by bike.<br/><br/> \n  \n\nAnglers may want to cast a line into the deep pools at nearby Toketie Lake. Populations of rainbow and cutthroat trout find \n\nhabitat in this somewhat secluded lake.<br/><br/> \n\n\nThe nearby Fourth of July Trail offers hikers expansive ridge line views and challenging terrain. Beginning in the \n\nforest at 4,000 feet, the trail quickly climbs in elevation, out of the trees into more open, arid landscapes. The trail \n\ncontinues, traversing through mountain meadows with spectacular views of the Stuart Mountain Range and Icicle Valley. At 10.6 miles, this is a solid day hike, though backpackers can hook up connecting trails to continue for multiple days though adjacent wilderness settings.  \n\n\n\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\nEightmile Group Campground has one large site that can accommodate up to 70 guests and 25 vehicles. The site is equipped with \n\npicnic tables, a group campfire ring, drinking water and vault toilets.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nOkanogan-Wenatchee National Forest offers stunning scenic views, with high, glaciated alpine peaks, valleys of old growth forest and rugged shrub-steppe country making up the diverse landscape. Elevations range from below 1,000 feet to over 9,000 feet.<br/><br/>  \n\nMore than 700 lakes and mountain ponds dot the glacier-carved terrain of nearby Alpine Lake Wilderness. Tree-covered valleys give \n\nway to rocky ridges and rugged peaks along the crest of the Cascades. Many peaks and slopes are permanently cloaked in \n\nsnowfields. From wet forests of Douglas fir, cedar, and an understory of salal and berries, to firs and mountain hemlock, the \n\nlandscape opens up to expansive meadows matted with low growth and ends with dry forestland of ponderosa pine and \n\ngrasses.<br/><br/>\n \nCongress designated the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in 1976 with a total of 362,789 acres.

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview:</h2>Riddle Brothers Ranch is part of the historic context of pioneer settlement and the development of the livestock industry in the American West.  Walter, Frederick, and Benjamin Riddle were three bachelor brothers who secured home sites and raised livestock in and around the ranch.  Migrating from western Oregon, they settled in the early 1900s and built their ranch by gaining control of water in the area.  In the late 1950s the Riddle brothers sold their ranch holding to Rex Clemens.  In 1986 BLM purchased the property from Clemens and has since managed the ranch for its historic values. <h2>Know Before You Go:</h2><ul><li>Driving access into the Ranch is generally permitted Wednesday-Sunday from mid-June through October. High clearance, four-wheel drive vehicles are recommended. Access by foot, bicycle, or horseback is permitted anytime.</li><li>Amenities are few. A vault restroom is available, but drinking water, overnight use areas, cell phone service and other conveniences are not.</li><li>Avoid disturbing historical sites or artifacts.

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nCongo Gulch is an old Forest Service cabin that allows guests to relax in the outdoors and step back in time to when the cabin was used during bygone gold mining days. It is part of the Fremont Powerhouse complex, a hub for mining built in the early 1900s. As one of four cabins located at the site, the cabin offers flexibility for large groups. Guests can rent all cabins and also pitch tents in the grassy yard. \n  \nThe surrounding valleys once teemed with mining activity, primarily gold. The Fremont Powerhouse was built in 1908 as an economical method for mining. Two dams were constructed at Olive Lake, and water from the lake was piped through an 8-mile wood and steel pipeline to the powerhouse to generate electricity. Homes were constructed to shelter workers who monitored the pipeline. Today, these same shelters are available as recreational rentals.\n  \nCongo Gulch is named for the small creek that runs beside the property. Winter access may require skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nGuests can hike on North Fork John Day Wilderness Area trails or go mountain biking on forest roads. A drive along the Blue Mountain Scenic Byway is a treat, as are activities like huckleberry and mushroom picking, bird watching, wildlife viewing and photographing the vast landscape. Nearby Olive Lake offers boating, fishing and swimming.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n  \nThe two-story white cabin with wood siding and a metal roof can accommodate up to 12 guests. It features:\n· two bedrooms upstairs with dressers, a queen bed, 3 twins, and a full-over-queen bunkbed; \n· one bedroom downstairs with a dresser and full-over-queen bunkbed; \n· parlor with dining table/chairs, 2 futons and end tables; \n· kitchen with refrigerator, electric stove/oven, microwave, coffee pot, toaster, cookware, dishes, and a second dining table with chairs; \n· full bath with shower/tub and flush toilet. \nThe cabin has electric lights and an oil heating stove. A picnic table and brick fireplace are provided next to the pond (bring your own firewood). Cleaning supplies are also provided and renters are required to clean the house before they leave.\nWater is available June through September only. No water or indoor plumbing from October to May. Instead, an outhouse is available for use. In these seasons, guests are asked to bring plenty of water for drinking, cooking and washing. Other items to pack year-round include food, bedding, a first aid kit, flashlight, matches and all other basic camping gear. \nClick here for more cabin details.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe cabin sits at about 5,000 feet in elevation and is neatly tucked under a large Douglas-fir, next to a small pond. A grassy lawn in front spreads to the other three cabins in the area. The forest lies in the Blue Mountains and is home to Ponderosa pine lodgepole pine, larch, and Douglas fir. \n \nBirds in the area include the black-backed woodpecker, American kestrel and the boreal owl. Black bear, cougar, wolves, elk and deer are among the native land mammals. Click here to learn about bear safety.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe cabin is located less than six miles from Granite, Oregon, a ghost town that once bustled with prospectors and pioneers. The town provides groceries and fuel. Opportunities for horseback riding and a boat ramp, boating, fishing, and swimming are located within ten miles from the cabin.",

It is the first group site located on the north side of Mountain Loop Road, about 5 miles east of the Verlot Public Service Center in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.\n<br/><br/>\nWhether visitors choose to hike on trails leading into towering forests or enjoy a moment of solitude on the banks of the nearby Stillaguamish River, this campround offers opportunities to experience both the serene and wild aspects of the Cascade region.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nIn addition to being a prime location for hiking, fishing, picnicking, and horseback riding in summer and early fall, visitors can take advantage of skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months.\n<br/><br/>\nAnglers enjoy fishing from the gently-flowing Stillaguamish River. The Stillaguamish sustains a large salmon and trout population including chinook, coho, chum, pink and sockeye salmon, steelhead trout, sea-run cutthroat and bull trout.\n<br/><br/>\nGold Basin Mill Pond Interpretive Trail invites visitors to learn more about the natural and cultural history of the area. The short, accessible trail passes by mill relics and ends on a floating viewpoint, looking across the millpond. The trailhead is located directly across from Gold Basin Campground.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nWiley Creek Campground has two group sites that can accomodate up to 20 people each, with Adirondack shelters, tables and rock barbeque pits. Vault toilets are provided but there is no drinking water. Visitors must bring their own supply.\n<br/><br/>\nGroup A has two Adirondacks. One shelter can accomodate 8 people on bunk beds and the second can sleep 12 on the attic floor. About 250 square feet are available on each floor. \n<br/><br/>\nGroup B has a two-level shelter with about 400 square feet of space on each level.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest offers visitors the chance to explore the region's rugged peaks, scenic rivers and interesting wildlife that comprise the forest and surrounding designated wilderness areas.\n<br/><br/>\nExploring the banks of the Stillaguamish River, one will find unique ecosystems typical for the area. Old-growth forests of cedar, fir, and hemlock line the wide, gently-flowing river, and tower over trails winding through moss-covered rocks.\n<br/><br/>\nOn a clear day visitors will see Mt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area. The active volcano rises to an elevation of 10,781 feet, and is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker's summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.\n<br/><br/>\nUndeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests provide important habitat for wildlife, including birds, amphibians, reptiles and more rare species such as lynx, moose, wolves and wolverine.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nTraverse a portion of the spectacular Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), one of the world's premier National Scenic Trails. This trail showcases some of North America's most fantastic scenery as it winds its way from Mexico to Canada through California, Oregon and Washington.\n<h2>contact_info</h2>\nFor facility specific information, please call (360) 386-8214.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\n  \nCaretaker's Cabin allows guests to relax in the outdoors at the historic Fremont Powerhouse site.  As one of four cabins located at the site, the cabin offers flexibility for large groups, like weddings or reunions. Guests can rent all cabins (see Congo Gulch, Hilltop Hideaway, and Miner's Retreat) and also pitch tents in the grassy yard. Caretaker’s Cabin sits on a hill beside Miner’s Retreat and has parking access beside it. The cabin can accommodate up to 10 guests. Winter access may require skis, snowshoes or snowmobiles. \nIn the 1800s, the North Fork John Day drainage was bustling with gold and silver mining.  Around 1903, local mines began to notice a decline in earnings and promoted construction of a cheaper power source in an effort to operate the mines more economically.  As a result, the Fremont Powerhouse was constructed and began operation in 1908. Two dams were constructed at Olive Lake and water from the lake was piped through an eight-mile-long wood and steel pipeline to the powerhouse to generate the much-needed electrical power. The Caretaker’s Cabin house was constructed in the 1930s to shelter workers who monitored the pipeline for leaks and kept the powerhouse operating.  The entire site and pipeline are listed as an historic district on the National Register of Historic Places. <h2>Recreation</h2>\n Guests can hike on North Fork John Day Wilderness trails or go mountain biking on forest roads. A drive along the Blue Mountain Scenic Byway is a treat, as are activities like huckleberry and mushroom picking, bird watching, wildlife viewing and photographing the vast landscape. Nearby Olive Lake offers boating, fishing and swimming.<h2>Facilities</h2>\n  \nThe cabin is a 2-story house with wood siding and a shake shingle roof that can accommodate 10 guests. The cabin features: \n· two bedrooms upstairs with dressers, 2 twin beds, and 2 full-over-queen bunkbeds; \n· parlor with 2 futons and end tables; \n· dining room with a table and chairs to seat 10; \n· kitchen with refrigerator, electric stove/oven, microwave, coffee pot, toaster, cookware, and dishes; \n· bathroom with flush toilet and claw-footed tub (no shower).  \nOutside there is a fire ring and picnic table--prior to arrival please contact the District office to determine whether fires have been banned. The cabin has electric lights and electric wall heaters. Cleaning supplies are also provided and renters are required to clean the house before they leave.\nWater is available June through September only. No water or indoor plumbing from October to May. Instead, an outhouse is available for use. In these seasons, guests are asked to bring plenty of water for drinking, cooking and washing. Other items to pack year-round include food, bedding, a first aid kit, flashlight, matches and all other basic camping gear. Click here for more cabin details.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nPerched on a small rise at about 5,000 feet in elevation, the cabin is set on a hillside under a large spruce tree. A grassy lawn in front spreads to the three other cabins in the area. The forest lies in the Blue Mountains and is home to Ponderosa pine, lodgepole pine, larch and Douglas-fir. \n \nBirds in the area include the black-backed woodpecker, American kestrel and the boreal owl. Black bear, cougar, wolves, elk and deer are among the native land mammals. Click here to learn about bear safety.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe cabin is located less than 6 miles from Granite, Oregon, a ghost town that once bustled with prospectors and pioneers. The town provides groceries and fuel. Opportunities for horseback riding are within 10 miles of the cabin.",

Its diverse landscape includes pumice flats, deep gorges and chutes, and unique ecological systems.</p><p>The Upper Rogue River is fed by snowmelt and springs originating on the peaks of the Cascade Range, including the slopes of Mt. Mazama—the volcanic caldera that contains Crater Lake. Along the uppermost portion of the Upper Rogue, the river is narrow and shallow, but very swift. Numerous moss-draped snags of lodgepole pines and other trees that have fallen across the river slow its pace only a little. The river has, for a two-mile stretch, carved more than 200 feet down into the Mazama pumice (which was deposited about 8,000 years ago during the explosion that created Crater Lake). This sheer, white-walled canyon, with the whitewater river glinting in the sunlight far below, is a favorite sight for travelers along Highway 230.</p><p>Downstream, the Upper Rogue passes through the narrow, turbulent <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2Hb2O7f\" rel=\"nofollow\">Rogue Gorge</a> of black lava and soon plunges entirely underground (into a lava tube) for about 250 feet at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2syhDLP\" rel=\"nofollow\">Natural Bridge</a>. Interpretive trails at both of these places provide good views of the river, with signs that explain the natural history. Fed by tributaries, such as Union Creek and Flat Creek, the river subsequently flows through rugged Takelma Gorge, well out of sight of any road. The Upper Rogue features several waterfalls, although the more <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2IJTbls\" rel=\"nofollow\">spectacular falls</a> are located on tributaries National Creek and Muir Creek.</p><p>The entire length of the Upper Rogue Wild and Scenic River is closely followed by the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2sF1Vyz\" rel=\"nofollow\">Upper Rogue River Trail</a>, designated a <a href=\"https://www.trails50.org/national-trails/\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Recreation Trail</a>. Because of the various road crossings, much of this hiker-only trail (open to equestrians for short sections near Hamaker Campground) is easily traveled for short segments at a time.</p><p>In addition to its clear, clean water and scenic beauty, the Upper Rogue is notable for its history. Parallel to Highway 62 between Farewell Bend and Natural Bridge, it passes through part of the Union Creek Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places for the rustic 1920s-30s buildings at <a href=\"http://www.unioncreekoregon.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Union Creek Resort</a> and the nearby former ranger station. At Union Creek Wayside, a traveler's comfort station along Highway 62, an interpretive kiosk tells the history of Union Creek.</p><p>The Upper Rogue is considered extremely hazardous for whitewater boating due to its gorges, chutes and many obstructions, ranging from \"sweeper\" logs across the river to the underground section at Natural Bridge. <strong>For the entire wild section of the Upper Rogue and some portions of the scenic sections, we recommend no boating due to ever-changing instream hazards. </strong>Certain portions of the main scenic section of the Upper Rogue can be floated, with hard-shell kayaks being the most appropriate and preferred craft on this challenging section with always changing instream hazards. <strong>This is a river for experienced-to-expert boaters.</strong></p>",

Mc Loughlin, near a beautiful meadow of the same name. The camp offers many amenities to make you and your horses feel at home.\n<br/><br/>\nThe camp was converted to a horse camp in 1990 with the addition of 19 miles of interconnecting horseback riding trails. The renovation was made possible through a partnership between the Forest Service and the Coalition of Equestrian Clubs, which provided much of the labor for this wonderful facility.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nWillow Prairie Horse Camp offers equestrian access to a wide variety of trails. Rugged peaks, sparkling lakes and forested areas provide the backdrop for many of these rides.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nWillow Prairie offers large equestrian sites, each with corrals, a picnic table, campfire ring with grill and ample parking. Vault toilets and drinking water are provided.\n<br/><br/>\nA watering trough is available for horses, and a trailer is left on-site for campers to deposit manure and hay upon departure.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe unique character of the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest is composed of two distinct geological provinces: the Cascade Range and the Siskiyou Mountains. The Cascade Range is dominated by snow-capped volcanic peaks such as 9,495' Mt. Mc Loughlin within the Sky Lakes Wilderness. The Siskiyou area embodies world-class wild rivers, remarkable fisheries and the most complex and treasured plant communities in the Pacific Northwest.  \n<br/><br/>\nAdjacent to the camp is a wetland area featuring beaver dams and several large ponds where wildlife abounds. Sandhill cranes, Canada geese, ducks, elk, deer and many others frequent the area.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nWillow Prairie Guard Station was constructed on the edge of the meadow in 1924 by a Forest Service road crew. Its main purpose at that time was as a firefighter guard station. The original cabin was recently restored by local volunteers and employees of the Butte Falls Ranger District. \n<br/><br/>\nFish Lake is just 10 minutes from Willow Prairie.

It provides stellar mountain views and access to a variety of outdoor recreation opportunities, including hiking, mountain biking and wildlife viewing. During the winter months, the lookout is popular among hunters and winter sports enthusiasts.\n  \nIn the winter the lookout can only be accessed by skiing, snowmobiling or snowshoeing up to 3 miles from a parking area at the Billy Bob Sno-Park. A permit is required to park and the trek takes about three to four hours. In the summer guests can drive directly to the lookout but will need a gate code once their reservation is made. Guests are responsible for their own travel arrangements and safety, and must bring several of their own amenities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nIn the summer months, visitors enjoy hiking, horseback riding and mountain biking in the area, as well as the gorgeous views from the lookout. The lookout is near Eightmile Creek and Eightmile Trail, which travels through and around a riparian area, old growth pine forests and meadows dotted with wildflowers.\n<br/><br/>\nThe area is popular among winter sports enthusiasts as well, as the location provides access to numerous cross country skiing, snowshoeing and snowmobiling trails. It is a shared winter recreation area and lookout guests should expect other winter sports enthusiasts in the area.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe cabin is atop a 40-foot tower and is surrounded by a wooden catwalk. The 14-by-14 room is furnished with a small bed, a wood stove for heating and a table and chairs. It has a propane cook stove and solar-powered lights.

This is a \"Pack it in, Pack it out\" facility; guests will need to carry out all trash and clean the facility prior to leaving.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe lookout was originally a small cab on a 30-foot tower, established in the 1920s. In 1932, a standard lookout tower was built to replace the earlier lookout, but was destroyed by heavy snow in 1942. A non-typical lookout structure was rebuilt at the site in 1957.\n<br/><br/>\nThe tower sits on Fivemile Butte, at an elevation of 4,627 feet. It is surrounded by ponderosa pine, Douglas fir and western hemlock forests. Numerous creeks run through the area.

It is accessible by car, but the last 7 miles of the road are rough and narrow. \n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nAnglers enjoy fishing for brook trout and cutthroat on upper and lower Timpanogas Lakes, even though the lakes are closed to motorcraft. Canoeing is also possible on\nthe lakes.<br/><br/> \n\nThose not inclined to fish can enjoy hiking or mountain biking on numerous trails in the Timpanogas area, especially in late August when huckleberries are ripe for picking. This includes the Timpanogas Lake Trail, which starts at the Timpanogas Campground.<br/><br/> \n\nThe Diamond Peak Trail Area, Pacific Crest Trail and Diamond Peak Wilderness are also nearby.\n\n <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThis rustic 15 x 18 shelter with a dirt floor is designed to accommodate 6-8 people and comes equipped with a sleeping loft, a table with benches and a wood stove for heat.

Popular with whitewater enthusiasts, this campground offers a raft put-in that is the start of many memorable raft trips.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nBoulder Flat Campground is in a prime location for hiking, mountain biking, fishing, and whitewater rafting, often times seeing die hard rafters all year long.  The concrete raft launch is busy throughout the spring and summer, and changing rooms provide privacy for those needing to prepare for their whitewater adventures.  The popular 79-mile North Umpqua Trail, with multiple trailheads in the vicinity, offers hikers and bikers of all abilities the opportunity to gain some serious mileage or to just take a leisurely stroll or ride.  Nearby Twin Lakes offers some of the most spectacular and breathtaking views in the area and makes for a great get-away to have a picnic or do some wildlife viewing.  Just up the highway is the popular Toketee Falls. <h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>This campground has nine campsites equipped with picnic tables and fire rings.

All roads and parking spurs within the campground are paved.   All but one of the campsites has river access.  All campsites require reservations. Reservations must be made two days in advance.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nVisitors to the Umpqua National Forest are often taken aback by the unique landscapes of southwestern Oregon.  Explosive geologic events have shaped the distinctive landscape on the nearly 1 million acre forest that provides spectacular scenery as well as an abundance of natural and cultural resources. <br/><br/>\n\nThe translation of the word \"Umpqua\" meaning \"thundering waters,\" defines the area.  High mountain lakes, heart-stopping rapids, peaceful ponds and thundering waterfalls, including the 272 foot Watson Falls on the North Umpqua Highway, offer visitors plenty of pastimes.  <br/><br/>\n\nDiverse ecosystems support a wide range of habitat for wildlife common to the area.  From eagles and owls, to salamanders and salmon, these species, along with many others, depend on surrounding undeveloped wilderness, clean streams, and diverse forests to live and thrive.  \n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nOpportunities for hiking, mountain biking, wildlife viewing and climbing access are within 10 miles of the campground.\n\nVisitors may want to take some time to visit nearby Crater Lake National Park, the only national park in Oregon!  The amazing Crater Lake area offers a glimpse into the volcanic history of the area.  \n\nExperience 172 miles of diverse river and mountain landscapes along the Rogue-Umpqua National Scenic Byway.

Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, the Miller River Group Campground offers some of the most stunning scenery in the northern Cascade Range in Washington.<br/><br/>\n\nNestled in a mixed conifer forest, the sites in this campground are widely spaced and within walking distance to the river, ideal for visitors wanting to enjoy the serenity of an isolated setting.<br/><br/>  \n\nThe campground also a great jumpoff point for a multitude of recreational activities along either the Skykomish River, in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness or near Stevens Pass.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nIn addition to being a prime location for hiking and fishing in summer and early fall, Miller River offers excellent skiing and snowshoeing in the winter months.<br/><br/> \n\nThe Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest's 1,500 miles of trails can entice any hiker to get outdoors. From smooth paths meandering through deep quiet forests to challenging ascents up boulder-studded mountains, opportunities abound for every skill level.<br/><br/>\n\nThe nearby Dorothy Lake Trail begins in a densely shaded forest for approximately 1.5 miles to the outlet of Dorothy Lake, then continues along the lake's eastern edge for another 2 miles to its inlet. From here the trail climbs steeply over a ridge and enters the Snoqualmie Ranger District. Permits are needed for both day-use hiking and overnight backpacking and camping in Wilderness Areas.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nMiller River Group Campground offers one reservable group site and 18 standard sites available on a first-come, first-served basis.<br/><br/> \n\nPicnic tables, vault toilets, campfire rings and drinking water are available.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nHemmed in by several designated wilderness areas, the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest showcases rugged peaks, sparkling alpine lakes and old-growth forests.<br/><br/>\n\nMt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness Area, dominates the landscape on a clear day. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano from which the forest takes its name is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker's summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.<br/><br/>\n\nMore than 700 lakes and mountain ponds dot the glacier-carved terrain of nearby Alpine Lake Wilderness. Tree-covered valleys give way to rocky ridges and rugged peaks along the crest of the Cascades. Many peaks and slopes are permanently cloaked in snowfields. <br/><br/>\n \nCongress designated the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in 1976 with a total of 362,789 acres, 117,862 of which lie in the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest.\n<h2>contact_info</h2>\nFor facility specific information, please call (360) 386-8214.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nVisitors enjoy the North Cascades and Mt. Rainer National Parks, where interpretive programs and exhibits offer education about the diverse landscape and history of the area.<br/><br/>\n\nThe Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), one of the world's premier National Scenic Trails, showcases some of North America's most fantastic scenery, winding its way its way from Mexico to Canada through California, Oregon and Washington, and is accessible near the campground.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p><strong>Once </strong>your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

In 1843, a small eruption of Mt. Baker caused a forest fire, and visitors can still see the burned snags of virgin cedar trees that once dominated the area. The trail contours above the eastern shoreline of Baker Lake.\n  \nThe Shadow of the Sentinels Trail begins just south of the campground. This  accessible interpretive trail winds through a 500-year old ancient forest. Displays along the path explain the dynamics of the forest. The trail is constructed of asphalt and boardwalks with grades no greater than 8%.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nBoulder Creek Campground accommodates both tent and RV campers, and contains a group site. Picnic tables, campfire rings and vault toilets are provided, but drinking water and hookups are not available. Visitors must bring their own supply of water.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest showcases rugged peaks, sparkling alpine lakes and old-growth forests, providing visitors with unique and surprising landscapes.\n  \nMt. Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness, dominates the landscape on a clear day. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker's summit, Grant Peak, is a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.\n  \nWildlife in the area includes mountain goats traversing the higher elevations to squirrels and black bears in the forests. Migratory birds and native fish find ample habitat in the varied ecosystems as well.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n Hike in the mountains above the lake in the Mt. Baker National Recreation Area or Mt. Baker Wilderness or take some time to visit North Cascades National Park. This unique park features a deep blue lake surrounded by sheer, 2,000' cliffs, two picturesque islands and a violent volcanic past. Hiking trails, a visitor center and educational programs are available.  \n<h2>contact_info</h2>\nFor facility specific information, please call (360) 386-8214.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Once your reservation start date has begun, neither the Recreation.gov Contact Center nor the campground manager will be able to modify your reservation.</p>\n",

It is located on the banks of the Collawash River, which flows into the mighty Clackamas River in the mountains of northern Oregon. <br> <br><br>Recreational opportunities are not far from the campground, making it the perfect getaway spot. It can comfortably accommodate any outdoorsman, including the hiking enthusiast, the fly fisherman, bicyclist and whitewater rafter, among others who wish to enjoy nature.</p>\n<h2>Recreation</h2>\nCatch and release fishing for trout is allowed on the main fork of the Collawash, but the streams are closed to fishing for salmon and steelhead. Whitewater rafting and kayaking are popular activities. At least one 5-mile stretch of the more than 17-mile river boasts class III-IV whitewater. <br/> <br/>\nThe Collawash flows into the nearby Clackamas River, which also provides miles of wild water as it snakes through the scenic Cascade Range. Anglers enjoy fishing the Clackamas for steelhead, Kokanee and Chinook salmon. The river provides a perfect habitat for the federally protected bald eagle and northern spotted owl, as well as an occasional peregrine falcon. A variety of other wildlife makes its home in the area. <br/> <br/>\nVisitors enjoy hiking in the Bull of the Woods Wilderness, which is south of the campground. Several primitive forest roads nearby are open to mountain biking. \n<br/> <br/>\nWest Cascades Scenic Byway runs just outside the campground, meandering along the Wild and Scenic Clackamas River.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground offers six group campsites for tent and RV camping. Large RVs, however, might have a hard time negotiating tight turns within the campground .The sites are limited to no more than four RVÃ¢Â?Â?s per RV group. Utility hookups are not available and parking surfaces are mostly gravel and mossy. <br/> <br/>\nThe group sites can accommodate between 30 to 60 people. Picnic tables and campfire rings with grills are provided, as are accessible vault toilets. Drinking water is not available. Firewood & water is available for purchase at the camp store.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe campground is located southeast of the city of Estacada, on the Collawash River at an elevation of about 1,500 feet. It lies in a dense forest of old-growth Douglas fir trees and plentiful rhododendron bushes that provide privacy between campsites.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nBagby Hot Springs is located about 10 miles southwest of the campground. A popular site for soaking and relaxing, the springs are in a heavily wooded area in the scenic Cascade Range. A historic guard station was built there in 1913 and the available bathhouses are fed by three major hot springs and several minor outlets in the area.",

It connects to the Pacific Crest National Scenic Trail, which winds its way through the area, past Timothy Lake and up the slopes of Mt. Hood. The long-distance trail is popular among hikers and backpackers, stretches 2,650 miles through California, Oregon and Washington, from Canada to Mexico.\n<br/><br/>\nVisitors enjoy fishing at Timothy Lake, which covers roughly 1,400 acres. Anglers will find Kokanee salmon and a variety of stocked trout.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground offers more than a dozen single-family sites for tent and RV camping. Each site is equipped with a table and campfire ring with grill. Accessible vault toilets are provided. A hand-pump water spigot is located near the campground's entrance and is the only source of water within the facility. Utility hookups are not available. Parking surfaces are grass, dirt and irregularly shaped.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe quiet campground is nestled in an evergreen forest at an elevation of 3,300 feet. Little Crater Lake is a geologic oddity, possibly formed by artesian water forcing its way through soft, volcanic rock. The beautiful, turquoise water is a wonder to see. \n<br/><br/>\nThe surrounding meadow is a great place for observing birds and other wildlife. The region is ripe for huckleberry picking as well.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe Clackamas Lake Ranger Station Historic District is less than 10 miles from the campground. It was built to house forest service workers in the early 1900s. The rustic architecture and historic nature of the buildings and the surrounding area draws thousands of visitors each year.",

The unique setting offers many recreational activities and scenic views. Baker Lake is close by, and many hiking trails and climbing routes are within a short driving distance.<h2>Recreation</h2>\n  \nIn addition to being a great basecamp for hiking, boating and fishing in summer and early fall, Park Creek can be a starting point for snowshoeing in the winter months.\n \nTrails in the area can entice any hiker to get outdoors. From smooth paths meandering through deep quiet forests to challenging ascents up boulder-studded mountains, opportunities abound for every skill level.\n \nShadow of the Sentinels Trail, a barrier-free interpretive trail winding through dense forest growth, is a short drive away. Huge Douglas fir and cedar trees tower above a forest floor of ferns, moss and berry bushes, and interpretive signs along the route explain the dynamics of this 500-year-old ancient forest. The trail is constructed of asphalt and boardwalks with grades no greater than 8 percent.\nThe nearby Baker Lake Trail is an easy family hike that begins in a majestic stand of Douglas fir. In 1843, a small eruption of Mt. Baker caused a forest fire, and visitors can still see the burned snags of virgin cedar trees that once dominated the area. The trail contours above the eastern shoreline of Baker Lake.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nPark Creek campground offers standard sites, accommodating both tent and RV camping.

Baker, the most prominent feature of the Mt. Baker Wilderness, dominates the landscape on a clear day. Rising to an elevation of 10,781 feet, the active volcano is perpetually snow-capped and mantled with an extensive network of creeping glaciers. Mt. Baker's summit, Grant Peak, is a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater. \n \nWildlife in the area includes mountain goats traversing the higher elevations to squirrels and black bears in the forests. Migratory birds and native fish find ample habitat in the surrounding ecosystems.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\n Hike in the mountains above the lake in the Mt. Baker National Recreation Area or Mt.

It is one of the oldest structures on Mt. Hood and provides shelter for warmth and an escape from the elements while participating in a variety of activities, specifically winter-related recreation. During the winter months it serves as a winter retreat for visitors hardy enough to access the cabin from the Tilly Jane Sno-Park.<br/><br/>\n\nGuests can access the cabin following a 9-mile, gently sloping road, or via the historic Tilly Jane Ski Trail, which is roughly 2.7 miles with an elevation gain of 1,900 feet. Skis with skins or snowshoes are highly recommended and travelers should be prepared for extreme weather conditions. The TJ Ski Trail is poorly marked due to the 2008 Gnarl Ridge Fire so be on notice.  Guests should be experienced in backcountry travel and survival skills.  Guests must also bring several of their own amenities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nVisitors to the Guard Station enjoy a variety of recreational activities, including hiking, snowshoeing and backcountry skiing, which can be done most of the year due to high levels of snowfall in the area. Many trails exist in the area, prompting exploration. Most trails are not marked so visitors should be familiar with the area.  \n\nAbove the tree line, visitors can catch a glimpse of Mt. Adams, St Helens, Mt. Rainier and the Hood River Valley flanked by the dry high desert of eastern Oregon.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe cabin accommodates up to 8 people.  It includes a full kitchen and a second story sleeping loft with pads.  It has propane lighting and a cooking stove/oven, as well as all cooking pots and utensils. A variety of seating is available, as well as a table and chairs. A fireplace and woodstove with firewood are also provided.   An on-site pit toilet is located within the wood room of the cabin.  Water is obtained by melting snow or by digging an access hole to Tilly Creek.  We recommend all water be treated.<br/><br/>\n\nGuests will need to bring their own bedding, clothing, food, garbage bags and toilet paper. A variety of house rules exist, including proper closure of the cabin, which involves shutting off the gas, reinstalling the shutters and locking the cabin up. The cabin will need to be cleaned prior to leaving, dishes washed and everything in its place. Guests will also need to replenish a supply of wood and kindling for the next group. All food and garbage must be removed from the cabin.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe Guard Station is located high on the northeast side of Mt. Hood at an elevation of 5,700 feet. It was built in 1934 and initially received seasonal use for back country access and fire protection. The cabin is one of five structures in the area built in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps and is part of the Cloud Cap/Tilly Jane Historic District. The facility is operated and maintained by the volunteer organization, Oregon Nordic Club, under a permit from the U.S. Forest Service.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\n<p>Standard Rec.gov change/cancellation policy's apply.</p>\n<p>Cancellations with less than 14 days notice will pay a $10 service fee AND forfeit the first night's reservation fee.</p>\n",

Look for the Cooper Spur Inn sign and turn right off Highway 35, just north of Olallie Trailhead, onto Forest Road 3510 and drive to Copper Spur Inn. Turn left at the Cloud Cap/Tilly Jane Road 3512. The first trailhead is just past the intersection with Forest Service Road 620, with parking on the right and the trail on the left side of the road. The second option is to follow the Cloud Cap Road (FS Road 3512). This is the 9 mile gently sloping road.<br/><br/>  \n\nThe safest way to ski down is the Cloud Cap Road (FS Road 3512). This can be a long (9 mile), extremely difficult slog if there is soft snow. The Old Wagon Road shortens this distance by about 4 to 5 miles, but involves steep slopes in the upper section of the road. The shortest route and probably the safest in poor snow conditions is to ski or walk down the Tilly Jane Ski Trail, a distance of 2.7 miles.",

            "FacilityDescription": "<h2>Overview</h2>\nAmerican Ridge Lodge is located approximately 38 miles west of Naches, Washington in the foothills of the East Cascades mountain range. The lodge is available for reservation year-round, offering visitors a glimpse into the unique ski history of the area. Larger groups and gatherings will find this spacious facility to be an ideal setting for recreation and relaxation.\n   \nIn the 1930s, the Yakima Valley Ski Club worked with the U.S. Forest Service to construct the American River Ski Bowl, one of the first downhill ski areas in Washington State. The rustic ski lodge and unique 20-seater outhouse were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in connection with the ski area, which was operated into the 1950s.\n    \nBy the late 1950s, White Pass Ski Area was built, offering deeper snow, a longer ski season and steeper slopes. American Ridge Ski Bowl lay vacant for years, until the lodge and outhouse were carefully restored and made available to the public for reservation.  <h2>Recreation</h2>\nIn the summer and early fall, guests will find excellent hiking, fishing, horseback riding, and mountain biking opportunities in the area. Skiing, snowshoeing, sledding and snowmobiling are available in the winter months. \n<br/><br/>\nAdditionally, hundreds of small pools, ponds, rivers and lakes are home to populations of brook, rainbow and cutthroat trout, as well as salmon, drawing anglers from all over. <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe rustic and spacious 43 x 48 foot lodge, although largely unfurnished, is equipped with a kitchen area, counter space and benches, several closets and cabinets, and a wood stove.\n<br/><br/> \nOutside, there is a fire ring and picnic tables, as well as plenty of room on the grounds for dispersed camping, making it an ideal location for groups. There are no beds at this facility. Visitors must supply their own wood for the wood stove and fire ring.\n<br/><br/> \nThe lodge does not have water or electricity on site, but pitcher pump water is available during the summer months from Cedar Springs Campground located approximately 1.5 miles from the site. In the fall, winter and spring, visitors must bring plenty of their own water for drinking, cooking and washing.\n<br/><br/>\nVisitors must also bring their own light source. Battery powered lanterns are suggested and guests are asked to respect the facility's open flame policy, which prohibits the use of all open flame devises such as propane stoves, gas lanterns and candles, while inside the lodge.\n<br/><br/> \nSleeping bags, sleeping pads, towels, dish soap, matches, a first aid kit, toilet paper and garbage bags are not available at the lodge, and must be brought by guests to the lodge. <h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe lodge is located just outside the boundary of the William O. Douglas Wilderness, at an elevation of 3,041 feet. Defined by 166,000 acres of snow-capped peaks, rocky ridges, steep slopes and hundreds of pools and lakes, this magnificent region pays tribute to wilderness advocate and Supreme Court justice, William Orville Douglas, who often explored the area on foot.\n   \nWildlife viewing is plentiful in the areas surrounding the lodge. Large herds of elk and mule deer may cross the landscape, sharing forest habitat with black bear, squirrels and grouse.\n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nHikers may want to traverse a portion of the spectacular  Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) , one of the world's premier National Scenic Trails. Enjoy some of North America's most fantastic scenery, as the trail winds from Mexico to Canada through Washington state.    \n Boulder Cave Trail  is one of the most popular places in the Naches District. Visitors can walk the accessible trail along the river or explore Boulder Cave. Interpretive signs along the trail explain the geology, plants, animals and history of the area.  Horseback riding trails are within 1 mile of the lodge, and opportunities for group picnicking, hiking, mountain biking, hunting and fishing are within 10 miles.",

The combination to the gate lock will be included in your confirmation letter. \n \nFrom Naches, WA travel west on US Highway 12 for 4.4 miles.

Before the advent of airplane surveillance for fire detection, there were more than a dozen lookouts on the Tiller Ranger District. Today Acker Rock and Pickett Butte are the only remaining lookouts on the District.  \n\nThe lookout tower is generally available for reservation from August 1st thru November 15th (depending on snow).  High clearance all-terrain vehicles are recommended for travel to this site, and guests must bring several of their own amenities.  The lookout is not rented during the winter months due to wind and snow weight restrictions on the building.  \n\n\n\nVisitors should keep in mind everything must be packed in via a moderately steep 0.4-mile hike along a forested trail to reach the lookout.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe panorama includes landmarks on the Rogue-Umpqua Divide; on a clear day you can see mountains on the Willamette, Rogue, and Deschutes River watersheds and Crater Lake Rim.  Overlooking the Umpqua River and several of its tributaries, the lookout is a delightful setting for hiking, birding and wildlife viewing.  Seasonal changes envelope the area as snowmelt gives rise to spring flowers and vivid autumn colors bring with it numerous recreation opportunities.\n<br/><br/>\n\nFor a day trip, guests may enjoy a scenic drive along a portion of the 172-mile Rogue-Umpqua National Scenic Byway or a mountain hike into the Rogue Umpqua Divide wilderness on over 100 miles of trail.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe 12-foot by 12-foot, one-room lookout is furnished with a single bed, a small table and chair, and is equipped with a propane fueled wall heater, lanterns, cooking stove with oven and a refrigerator (propane is provided). A composting toilet is located at the lookout site. There is no water at the site, so visitors must bring plenty for drinking, cooking and washing. Potable water is available at a spigot in front of the Tiller Ranger Station office (45 minute drive). Guests must supply their own food, cooking utensils, sleeping bags, sleeping pads, towels, dish soap, matches, cooking gear, toilet paper and garbage bags. Although propane lighting is available, bringing an additional light source is recommended.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nUnique volcanic and sedimentary rock outcroppings and dense conifer forests define the landscape, giving way to sub-alpine meadows and summer wildflowers in the higher elevations.  The rock formation on which the lookout building sits is itself a magnificent feature. Sheer cliffs drop off for several hundred feet on the west and south sides. <br/><br/>\n\nThe translation of the word \"Umpqua,\" meaning \"thundering waters,\" defines the area. High mountain lakes, heart-stopping rapids, peaceful ponds and thundering waterfalls await visitor.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nOpportunities for fishing are within 10 miles of the lookout.",

Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Red Bridge Campground is a beautiful camp, offering visitors access to fishing, kayaking and hiking opportunities.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nThe Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest has 1,500 miles of trails. From smooth paths meandering through deep quiet forests to challenging ascents up a boulder-studded mountain, opportunities abound for every skill level.\n<br/><br/>\nThe Mt. Dickerman Trail switchbacks steeply for 3.0 miles through a dark forest of timber to an alpine meadow that was replanted in 1915 after a major forest fire. From this point, the trail rises above timberline to an alpine meadow full of wildflowers in July and August.\n<br/><br/>\nThe trail offers spectacular views in all directions as the trail climbs to the 5,723' summit.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nRed Bridge Campground offers single-family sites for both tent and RV camping. Picnic tables, campfire rings and vault toilets are available, however there are no electrical hookups or drinking water. Visitors must bring their own supply of water.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nRugged peaks, scenic rivers and abundant wildlife define the Mt. Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest and surrounding designated wilderness areas. On a clear day visitors can see Mt. Baker, which rises to an elevation of 10,781 feet. The active volcano is perpetually snow-capped. Mt. Baker's summit, Grant Peak, is actually a 1,300-foot-deep mound of ice, which hides a massive volcanic crater.\n<br/><br/>\nOld-growth forests line the wide, gently-flowing South Fork Stillaguamish River, known for its salmon run. Chinook, Coho, chum, pink and sockeye salmon, steelhead trout, sea-run cutthroat and bull trout use the river and its tributaries for spawning.\n<br/><br/>\nUndeveloped wilderness, clean streams and diverse forests provide important habitat for wildlife. Many species of mammals, birds, amphibians and reptiles make their homes in the area, which also sustains rare species such as lynx, moose, wolves and wolverine.\n<h2>contact_info</h2>\nFor facility specific information, please call (360) 386-8214.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nVisit or stay in one of the historic lookouts in the area.

The facility was used as his outdoor laboratory to instruct forestry students. \n<br/><br/>\nThe cabin was then turned over to the Forest Service and used as a guard station. Several restoration projects have kept the integrity and charm of this historic structure, which is now recorded in the Heritage Resource Inventory as a historic site.\n<br/><br/>\nThis cabin is available from July 1 until October 31 and is accessible via an unpaved road. High clearance and 4-wheel drive vehicles are recommended. Guests must bring some of their own supplies; however, Peavy Cabin does offers few modern conveniences to make for a comfortable stay.<h2>Recreation</h2>\n<p>Peavy Trailhead is adjacent to the cabin and provides access to the North Fork John Day Wilderness via the Peavy Trail #1640 and the Cunningham Cove Trail #1643. Both trails connect with the Elkhorn Crest National Recreation Trail #1611. These trails are suitable for hikers and horseback riders.<br><br><br>The North Fork John Day River is a popular fishing spot for anglers wishing to catch smallmouth bass and steelhead.</p>\n\n<p>For questions for Anthony Lake, Grande Ronde Lake, Mud Lake, Peavey Cabin, and Anthony Lake Guard Station call <strong>(541) 856-3277 ext. 114</strong></p>\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThis rustic, single-room log cabin contains a fireplace with a wood stove for heating, a large table and benches, and enough beds to sleep 4. The kitchen is equipped with a gas range, refrigerator and dry sink, as well as some cooking and serving utensils. \n<br/><br/>\nThe grounds are partially fenced and include a picnic table and wood shed. Space is available for additional tent camping. A vault toilet is located near the cabin.\n<br/><br/> \nThere is no potable water on-site, and guests must bring plenty for drinking, washing and cooking. Guests are expected to bring garbage bags to pack out trash and are required to clean the cabin before leaving. \n<br/><br/>\nBedding, towels, dish soap and emergency items like flashlights and first aid kits are not provided. Phone service, fuel, and a small general store with a cafe are located approximately 15 miles away in the community of Granite.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe cabin sits next to the Wild and Scenic North Fork John Day River at an elevation of 5,900 feet. The Wild and Scenic North Fork John Day River originates in the North Fork John Day Wilderness, and the Baldy Unit section of this wilderness is adjacent to the cabin. The Baldy Unit features diverse landscapes like the rolling benchlands and the granite outcrops of the Greenhorn Mountains.\n<br/><br/> \nMuch of the wilderness is composed of gentle benchlands and tablelands; the remaining of steep ridges and alpine lake basins. Dense virgin stands of conifer species like Douglas fir, white fir, western larch and lodgepole pine cover the landscape. The area also supports wildlife species like Rocky Mountain elk, mule deer, RockyMountain goats and black bears (<a href=\"http://www.fs.fed.us/outernet/r6/w-w/recreation/Visitor-safety/bears.shtml\" rel=\"nofollow\">information on bear safety</a>).\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nPeavy Cabin is 3 miles from the state-designated Elkhorn Scenic Byway.

Equestrian campers are welcome and a corral with trough is provided. \n \nThe guard station was originally built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the mid-1930s. It is a classic example of forest building structures of that era and is eligible for inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places. It was used by forest fireguards who would ride their horse deep into the forest’s interior to look for wisps of smoke from lightning strikes or check on communications lines along the Forest Service roads. It became a recreation rental in 1997. <h2>Recreation</h2>\n The route to the cabin is located off the Blue Mountain Scenic Byway, which boasts incredible views. Over 26 miles of hiking and horseback riding trails, ranging between 4,100 and 5,300 elevation, traverse forests and meadows throughout the Heppner Ranger District. Fishing opportunities abound in nearby streams, Penland Lake and Bull Prairie Lake. Other activities include hunting for deer and elk, mushroom and berry picking, wildlife viewing and enjoying the scenic landscape.  <h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe cabin is a one-story building containing a bedroom, living room, kitchen with nook and a bathroom. The cabin does not meet accessibility standards due to narrow doorways and halls. A picnic table, campfire ring and a 20' X 20' horse corral with water trough are located outside. Guests may pitch tents in the yard for additional sleeping options. \n \nTwo bunk beds, a dresser, and a chair are in the bedroom, and the living room has a futon, loveseat, side table, a dining table with four chairs, and a heating stove. A cook stove, fire extinguisher, cookware, silverware and dishes are included in the kitchen. All appliances and lighting are propane, which is provided by the Forest Service. \n \nPotable water is available. Guests must bring food, bedding, toiletries, matches, a flashlight, first aid kit and similar camping gear. Cleaning supplies are provided in a closet by the door and guests are expected to clean the cabin before they leave. Click here for more cabin details.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\n  \nThe cabin sits near Ditch Creek on a large, flat lawn surrounded by a dense pine forest at an elevation of 4,800 feet. The creek is one of numerous small perennial streams that flow south into the North Fork John Day River. There is a small pond adjacent that is also stocked with fish.\n \nDeer and elk are likely to be seen in the area, and as evening falls, guests can watch bats flit and swoop above the yard. \n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe nearest town with a general store is in Heppner, a 40-minute drive away, although ice and some food options are available at the Morrow County OHV park 14 miles away.",

Nestled in a mountainous forest near the confluence of Bridge Creek and Icicle Creek, the campground offers a delightful setting for groups and large gatherings.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nBridge Creek Group Campground offers outdoor enthusiasts the opportunity to hike, fish, bike and enjoy a long list of outdoor recreational activities throughout the year.<br/><br/> \n\nIcicle River, adjacent to the campground, offers a scenic backdrop for swimmers braving its cold, refreshing waters. Anglers may also want to cast a line into the deep pools lining the shore. Populations of rainbow and brown trout prevail in this waterway.<br/><br/>  \n\nThe nearby Fourth of July Trail offers hikers expansive ridge line views and challenging terrain. Beginning in the forest at 4,000 feet, the trail quickly climbs in elevation, out of the trees into more open, arid landscapes. The trail continues through mountain meadows with spectacular views of the Stuart Mountain Range and Icicle Valley. \n<br/><br/>  \nAt 10.6 miles, this is a solid day hike, though backpackers can hook up connecting trails to continue for multiple days though adjacent wilderness settings.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nBridge Creek Group Campground has one large site that can accommodate up to 75 people and 35 vehicles. The site is equipped with picnic tables, a group campfire ring, drinking water and vault toilets.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nOkanogan-Wenatchee National Forest offers stunning scenic views, with high, glaciated alpine peaks, valleys of old growth forest and rugged shrub-steppe country making up the diverse landscape.

It is located approximately 75 miles southeast of Eugene, Oregon in the Willamette National Forest.   \n\nThe guard station was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1933 and used as a dwelling for fire guards. They were the smoke chasers, often riding on horseback through the tall timbers to the location spotted by the lookout tower guards. The first on the scene, they often tried to put out any fires they may have found on their own, or reported back for additional help.   \n\nThe guard station is open from early May through the end of October and is easily accessible by car. Some creature comforts are provided, but guests should be prepared to pack in most of their own supplies and gear.  <h2>Recreation</h2>\nTrailheads into the Three Sisters Wilderness and the Chucksney Mountain Roadless Area are adjacent to the Guard Station.

The campground is not far from the Ripplebrook Ranger Station and Ripplebrook Pond.\n<br/><br/>\nThe river provides habitat for the federally protected bald eagle and northern spotted owl, as well as an occasional peregrine falcon. A variety of wildlife makes its home in the area.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nBagby Hot Springs is located about 14 miles southwest of the campground. A popular site for soaking and relaxing, the springs are in a heavily wooded area in the scenic Cascade Range.

Hiking and horseback riding trails extend into the William O. Douglas and Norse Peak Wilderness areas, and off-road vehicle and snowmobile access draws visitors to the Little Naches drainage.   \nHalfway Flat Campground is conveniently located 30 minutes below the summit of Chinook Pass and Mt. Rainer National Park. A trip along the scenic Mather Parkway is a fantastic outing. The Naches River, adjacent to the campground offers a scenic backdrop for anglers. Its cold, clear waters sustain populations of rainbow and brown trout. Whitewater enthusiasts may enjoy a paddle on the river or one of the many other tributaries.\n<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe campground has eight campsites, with five campsites available for advanced reservation between Memorial Day through Labor Day weekend. After, mid-September all sites are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Vault toilets and potable water are available.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe Okanogan-Wenatchee National Forest is defined by its diverse landscapes, boasting high, glaciated alpine peaks, lush valleys of old growth forest, and rugged shrub-steppe country. The Halfway Flat Campground is nestled in an old-growth forest of Douglas fir, western hemlock, and cedar with grassy areas, ferns and mosses covering the forest floor.  With the William O. Douglas and Norse Peak Wilderness areas nearby, the location is home to abundant wildlife, including deer, elk, porcupine, native fish and migratory birds.  Endangered and threatened species, including the Northern Spotted Owl, gray wolves, and grizzly bears also find havens in local ecosystems.  \n\nSummer temperatures are generally sunny and warm with little precipitation, and winters boast mostly clear skies, but plenty of snow.  \n\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nHikers may want to traverse a portion of the spectacular Pacific Crest Trail (PCT), one of the world's premier National Scenic Trails.   Boulder Cave Trail is one of the most popular places in the Naches District. Visitors can walk the accessible trail along the river or explore Boulder Cave.

The main attraction at Mount Rainier National Park is the mountain itself, a massive glacier-clad volcano,  peaking at 14,411 ft. and dominating the skyline for hundreds of miles. Visitors travel through majestic old-growth forests, past tumbling waterfalls and historic buildings to reach sub-alpine meadows, where world-famous wildflower displays bloom through July and August. Popular activities in the park include sight-seeing, hiking, rock climbing and camping.<br><br>Cougar Rock campground is located at an elevation of 3,180 feet. Summers are dry and cool with daytime temperatures ranging from 60 to 80 degrees.

Visitors must use extra caution with food storage, as foxes and other animals have been known to frequent the campground looking for food.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nCougar Rock Campground has one lookout point from which campers can view Mt. Rainier. Although it is peaceful now, the still active volcano last erupted in the mid 1800s. The campground is adjacent to the Nisqually River and is surrounded by thick forests.

The clear, cold water supports rainbow trout, whitefish, bull trout and kokanee salmon.<br/><br/>\n\nFor day hikers and backpackers, the area offers a wide variety of scenic terrain, ranging from riverside trails to routes in subalpine forests.<h2>Facilities</h2>\nPine Rest Campground is one of our few tent-only facilities so we cannot accommodate RVs or trailers.  This is a no water facility so campers will need to bring their own supply. All sites are equipped with a picnic table and campfire ring with grill and the campground has vault toilets available.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe headwaters of the adjacent Metolius River are at Metolius Springs at the base of Black Butte, a 3,076-foot cinder cone. The clear, cold river flows north from the springs through diverse coniferous forest and a landscape of volcanic activity. The area provides habitat for mammals such as mule deer, coyote and cougar. Migratory birds and native fish also call the area home.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nThe Camp Sherman Fish Viewing Platform allows visitors the chance to view a variety of types of fish while the Metolius Research Natural Area gives bird watchers ample opportunities. Visit the Metolius Fish Hatchery or Wizard Falls Fish Hatchery display ponds to observe and feed different types of salmon and other fish.<br/><br/>  \n\nThe Metolius-Windigo Trail, open to hikers, bikers and horses, is more than 100 miles in length and begins near the Metolius River headwaters west of the town of Sisters, Oregon. The trail was created in the 1980s primarily to serve long-distance horse riders seeking an alternative to the Pacific Crest Trail.<br/><br/>\n\nLava Lands Visitor Center in nearby Bend, Oregon, and the unique geological landscape of Newberry National Volcanic Monument draw visitors to the region as well. It is a great starting point for visitors to learn about the diverse landscape and history of the area through interpretive programs and exhibits.  Visitors can also explore the Lava River Cave, located in the Newberry National Volcanic Monument.

Visitors enjoy swimming, cycling, boating, canoeing, fishing and hiking the various trails near the river. \n<br/><br/>\nNearby is the inactive Bigfoot trap, found at the beginning of the trail, built in 1974 by the North American Wildlife Research Team. The trap was inspired by a miner who lived near the Applegate River who claimed to have found 18-inch-long, human-like tracks in his garden. The organization operated the trap, keeping it baited with carcasses for six years, but caught only bears. Currently the Forest Service keeps an eye on the trap, but otherwise does not maintain it<h2>Facilities</h2>\n<p>The campground has eight tent only campsites, three dry RV sites and one group site. Campsites are located along the Applegate River.  Camp trailers are not recommended due to tight corners and short campsite spur lengths. The day use area is adjacent to campground.<br><br><br><br>Drinking water and flush toilets are available. There are NO showers<br><br><br><br>Kayak and paddle board rentals are available at nearby Applegate Lake, $30 for 3-hrs or $45 all-day. There is also a boat ramp offered at the Lake.<br><br><br><br>Please note, there is a two-night minimum when you desire to reserve a Friday or Saturday night.</p>\n<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe unique character of the landscapes comprising the area has led to the designation of over 340,000 acres of the forest as wilderness, and over 200 miles of streams as National Wild and Scenic Rivers.\n<br/><br/>\nThe forest itself is composed of two distinct geological provinces, the Cascade Range and the Siskiyou Mountains. The Cascade Range is dominated by snow-c\napped volcanic peaks like the 9,495-foot Mt. McLoughlin, located within the Sky Lakes Wilderness. \n<br/><br/>\nThe Siskiyou area embodies the most complex and treasured plant communities in the Pacific Northwest. World-class wild rivers, biological diversity, remarkable fisheries and complex watersheds all define the Siskiyou.\n<br/><br/>Diverse landscapes provide habitat for a wide range of wildlife, from spotted owls and bull elk to salamanders and Sandhill cranes.\n<h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>\nStop by historic Jacksonville while in the area or enjoy special events like the Britt Festival. \n<br/><br/>\nThe nearby Rogue River National Recreation Trail, stretching 40 miles between Grave Creek and Big Bend, offers some of southwestern Oregon's most scenic landscapes and rewarding hiking experiences. This hiking-only trail follows the north bank of the Rogue River as it winds its way toward the Pacific Ocean.\n<br/><br/>\nVisitors enjoy Crater Lake National Park and learning about its unique natural and cultural history.

It is this remoteness that makes the 4-mile ski or snowshoe to the cabin worth the effort.  \n\nThe cabin was built by the Edelweiss Ski Club in 1990 and has room for 12 people. There are often occupants from several different groups staying in the cabin at the same time. Only a few basic amenities are offered, so guests should be prepared to pack in most of their own supplies and gear.<h2>Recreation</h2>\nSeveral winter recreation trails crisscross the area. The Hemlock Butte Trail, which is used to access the cabin, is a challenging backcountry ski experience. Skiers on this trail can enjoy views of Mount Thielsen, Mount Bailey and even the rim of Crater Lake on a clear day.  \n\nAdvanced skiers can make the difficult trek up Mount Bailey, a 2-mile trip from the cabin with an elevation gain of 3,300 feet.  \n\nSkiers should make sure to have proper backcountry equipment and be aware of  avalanche dangers .<h2>Facilities</h2>\nThe cabin is a three-story A-frame with a wood stove for heating the cabin and melting snow. The ground floor serves as the living area with benches around the stove. The middle floor is the sleeping area. The top floor is available for additional sleeping space via a wall-mounted ladder. The only provided cooking pot is for melting snow.   \n\nFirewood is provided through Edelweiss Ski Club volunteers and U.S. Forest Service staff, but guests are asked to use it conservatively. An outhouse with vault toilet is located near the cabin.   \n\nNo electricity or drinking water is provided. Guests typically melt snow to use for drinking, cooking and washing. The cabin does not have beds.  \n\nGuests should bring sleeping bags and pads, a camp stove, cookware and utensils, lanterns or flashlights, a first aid kit, matches, extra toilet paper and garbage bags. All trash and food should be packed out, and guests are expected to clean the cabin before leaving.<h2>Natural Features</h2>\nThe cabin is situated at the base of Southern Oregon's Mount Bailey in Umpqua National Forest, near scenic Diamond Lake. Mount Bailey is a popular ski destination, averaging 600 inches of snow per year and boasting 6,000 acres of ideal skiing terrain.   \n\nMount Bailey, part of the Cascade Mountain Range, is a shield volcano topped with a 2,000-foot tephra cone. The mountain is heavily forested with pine at lower elevations, which gives way to hemlock and fir at higher elevations. The peak rises above treeline and crests at 8,363 feet.<h2>Charges & Cancellations</h2>\nA $10.00 service fee will apply if you change or cancel your reservation. Late cancellations are subject to additional fees. For full details see NRRS Reservation Policy.",
